{{dialogue|Qi|Welcome. I have something very exciting to show you today.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Using the R47 Power Core Ultra, I was able to channel upwards of ten giga-joules per second of energy out of Condensed Power Stones without encountering any significant losses in efficiency.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The amplitude and frequencies of vibrations at higher joule inputs seem to be minimalized by an advanced internal stabilizer in the compression chamber, averting electro-thermal heat displacement. It's literally bending the law of thermodynamics!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Why are we here?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I've designed a {{textcolor|green|power suit}} running on the R47 Power Core Ultra! It'll greatly enhance the speed at which we can rebuild the bridge.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|It's a design I came up with at Vega 5, but I never believed we'd actually find the energy output to put it into practice. My inspiration for it comes from something very obscure. Something you two never would've heard of.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Isn't this one of the robots from that Old World entertainment show, what was it? Gungams?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Erm, must be a bizarre coincidence, I've never seen anything like that! Why would I be watching some random, obscure Old World entertainment show?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|In any case, this will be very useful. I was planning on using cranes, but with this, we can save a lot on the budget! Good job, Director.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|If I ever get my hands on any other R57 Cores, I'll be able to manifest even more superior designs! Ahem, here's the diagram for it.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I mean, it looks exactly like one of the Gungam robots...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|And look at the time! We all have a lot of work to do, so l'll bid you both good day.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Fine. ''Player'', when you're done with this Gungam mobile suit, give it to me. We should have the budget for it.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I heard that!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|So! This is it... The definitely-not-a-Gungam Mobile suit! While you were working, I factored this thing into my construction plan, and with it, we'll be able to finish what's left of the bridge base in just {{textcolor|green|two days}}!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|And since that's the case, I'll send word to Atara and have them {{textcolor|green|send us a bridge inspector}} on the double; we'll have water trains back in Sandrock in no time flat!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|That Qi really has an amazing mind... Though you'll never hear me say it to him. If his head got any more full of hot air, I think he might just float away. And we need him here, don't we!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Well, thanks again for all your efforts. I'll show Qi your work, I think he'll be very impressed with how faithful you've been to his design. Be ready to install those {{textcolor|green|Load Bearing Trusses}} you built before!}}
