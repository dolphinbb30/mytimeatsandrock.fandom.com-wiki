Title: The Duvos Times
Greetings, citizens of Sandrock! Do not be alarmed, you are in good hands!

And may I also happily welcome you to the very first issue of... The Duvos Times!

Though this occupation may come as a surprise for some, and an inconvenience for many, I encourage all of you to make the most of your time in detainment! Have a conversation with one of our soldiers! Learn something about the world! Share a military secret! Do exactly as you're told to avoid getting your head bashed in!

And, in the meantime, as you see how we operate, ask yourself, "Am I Duvos cannon fodder material?"

-Do you like long walks on the beach?
-Long walks on the beach, but the beach is constantly eclipsed by shadow and lightning?
-Do you like following orders?
-Do you like eating cabbage?
-Can you maybe deal with eating bugs if push comes to shove?
-Do you like a strong government and a definitive vision for the future?
-Have you ever breathed oxygen before?

If you're a Sandrock citizen and said "yes" to any of these, you may very well be on the wrong side of the war! 

Join Duvos today! Sign up by knocking on the Blue Moon to the rhythm of our national anthem. Apply at the nearest Duvos soldier near you!
