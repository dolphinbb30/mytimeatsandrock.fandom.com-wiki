{{dialogue|Catori|Fixed already? That was super quick. Thank you!}}

*''Just doin' my job, ma'am.''
*{{flirt}}''It's the least I can do for my girlfriend.''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Just doin' my job, ma'am.
|I promise to keep the customers from knocking it around in the future. Thanks for being such a good friend.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Haha! Wait... You're serious, aren't you.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Let's get this straight. I had a really nice time the other night. You're great. Really. But one date... one kiss... doesn't mean we're in a committed relationship.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|You know better than anybody how important this business is to me. I don't have the time or energy to put into a relationship. You deserve someone who makes you their number one priority. I just can't do that right now.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I'm afraid I let things get away from me the other night. You're real good company, and I haven't had an evening like that in a long time.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|So, I let my guard down and let you kiss me. For just a moment, I was a regular woman who didn't have a million responsibilities and worries.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Truth is, you're real special. If I could think only about myself, I think we could be pretty happy together. But that's not in the cards right now.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|What I want for myself is on the bottom of the priority list. My son is at the top. My business is next. And the town of Sandrock is after that.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|My time'll come later, when everything else is settled. I hope you understand.}}

*''I understand. Maybe someday?''
*''We're still friends, right?''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I understand. Maybe someday?
|Gosh, I really hope so. I'd hate if this was our only shot and I'm throwing it away.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=We're still friends, right?
|Of course! I would be sad to lose your friendship over a misunderstanding.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Anyway... thank you for fixing the rack so quickly.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|And don't worry about me. I think I have some jewelry I can sell to keep the bank off my back for awhile longer.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|reward={{NPC2|Catori|rp=5}}|Everything will turn out okay, eventually.}}
