*''How are things at the Outpost?''
*''Have you ever thought about our future...''
*''So, anything interesting happen lately?''
*''(Finish talking)''

{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=How are things at the Outpost?
|It's goin' good. Mainly keepin' monsters in the desert, makin' sure they ain't comin' close to Sandrock. You should come with me sometime, we can explore the desert, have the world to ourselves.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|I used to not care about anythin', jus' goin' into whatever danger facin' me. Now I know I gotta be careful, I ain't gonna sacrifice our future together.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=So, anything interesting happen lately?
|Haru wrote to me, seems like he's doin' well, settled in real good. I told him about our relationship... I reckon he's gonna be real happy for us!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Andy knows, an' he's real happy as well. He says the "gang" just got ten times more notorious. Haha, he's got an imagination, that boy.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=(Finish talking)
|Finished eatin'? Want somethin' else? Somethin' to drink?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Our future? I've given it some thought...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I know yer real busy with your workshop. I don't want you to be overworked, so I'm gonna help you out however I can.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I'll take more bounties, an' earn a little more money. You can jus' take commissions at your own pace.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|At night, I'll stop by the Blue Moon, bring us back a few dishes an' some Yakmel Milk...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Haha, maybe I'm thinkin' too much. But when I picture it... Of course, your dreams are important, too.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I ain't never been much of a talker. But when I'm with you, I feel at ease. Like I ain't gotta be on edge no more.}}

*''This dream life sounds amazing...''
*''It's okay, we can take this slowly.''
