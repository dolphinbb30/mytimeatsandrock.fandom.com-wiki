*''Maybe it'll give you some inspiration.''
*''I feel like you're drifting away from me...''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Maybe it'll give you some inspiration.
|Yes... I think you're right. Being stuck in this room just ruminating over each sentence won't do me any good. You win! I'll come with you.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=I feel like you're drifting away from me...
|You... I'm sorry. I've been so absorbed in my writing, I've pushed you aside... that's never my intention. I'll put this aside for a night, and we can go together.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Well, that settles it. I'll see you there. What? No, of course, I'll never break a promise to you, my dear.}}
