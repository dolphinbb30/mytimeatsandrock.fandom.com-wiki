{{dialogue|Luna|Hello hello! I've been meaning to meet you properly ever since I arrived, but, well, yesterday was just impossible with my show and everything... Anyway, here we are! Finally!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|I took a stroll earlier and wherever I went, people were telling me you built this, you planted that, basically everything I laid eyes on was your work! That's some concrete accomplishments... Much more concrete than my brother's paperbacks!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Hey now...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|I suppose Peach is looking out for him, 'cos you're way out of his league!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Oh, and Ernie said you were the reason his new book was so successful! We were all shocked when our Ernie wrote a love story... and a good one at that! Goes to show that reality is the best inspiration for fiction...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|...Including my breakthrough song! Well, technically he didn't write it, I just copied his love letter from when he was a kid... Guess what? That girl who received it reached out after hearing that song! After all these years!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Please, Luna...!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|What did ya think I was gonna say? Hiding anything, Ernie?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Of course not. Honey, this is the love letter I told you about. Our butler accidentally sent it out before I finished it. Looking back, that letter was but a poor imitation of love. I had no clue what love meant until I met you...}}

*''Oh yes, that letter! I remember it.''
*''I don't recall this conversation...''
*''You don't have to explain anything. I trust you.''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Oh yes, that letter! I remember it.
|Of course, you'd remember. I hold onto every word you've ever said, too.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=I don't recall this conversation...
|Really? I thought I mentioned it after my failed attempt at the housewarming party...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|Maybe I didn't. Starting to doubt myself now. Don't worry, honey, you have all the time in the world to hear about my childhood stories.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=You don't have to explain anything. I trust you.
|That's wonderful to hear, honey. Your trust means the world to me. I'll never break it, not in a million years.}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Alright, alright, lovebirds! For those interested, that's how it ended. Ernie never saw that girl again after he was, what, nine?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|She didn't reach out to meet me anyways. She was only interested in getting Luna's autographs...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|No kidding! She asked for twenty autographs to give her "friends," at a good price, I suppose. To think that Ernie used to have a crush on this gem...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Let's not dwell on the past, huh? So... how long are you planning to stay in Sandrock?}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Already trying to get rid of me? I only just got here! I'd say a couple more days before Ma and Pa start getting suspicious about my tour dragging on for too long... They've been hounding me to get back home.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Then let's not waste any time. Let's eat! I've ordered all the local specialties, so forget about your diet â€“}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Wait, one more thing!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|...}}
