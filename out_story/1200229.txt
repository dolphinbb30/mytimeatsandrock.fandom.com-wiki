Title: Green Gas Gunks up Gorge
Gas in your canyon? It's more likely than you think.

Following an incident at the Blue Moon that we shall never speak of again, more bad news struck just the following day.

We all know the Valley of Whispers: that quaint, funny little canyon oozing with toxic chemicals. What could go wrong, right? Well, as it turns out, all of that toxic ooze is in fact, bad.

And it's really ramped up recently! Before we were pretty "live and let live" with the ooze, just staying out of its way, allowing it to ooze peacefully oozily in its little ooze-zone, but as of just recently, a lot of the gas has been floating out of the canyon and infecting citizens and critter alike!

Note that the symptoms resulting from gas exposure are extremely mild, though long-term effects are still unknown so... Probably best to avoid the gas whenever possible. I mean, have you ever heard anyone say, "Dang, I really regret not inhaling more toxic chemicals?" So yeah, even if effects are mild, probably better to just... not.

Nevertheless, our brave Civil Corps is on the case! With ''Player'' taking the lead, our Corps plans to head down to the canyon as soon as possible and find out what the darn dealio is already!

That green gas has got to go!
