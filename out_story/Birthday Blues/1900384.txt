{{dialogue|Catori|Did I ever show you what he looks like? This is the picture Ma sent me a few weeks ago.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Isn't he handsome? Looks a lot like my Pa. Ma says he started his own business, selling his classmates snacks he made at home.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Got a head for business, that one. Just like his Ma. Or... maybe not just like me.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Most days, I know I made the right choice coming here to build us a better life. But it's taking so long. On days like today, I feel like the worst mother ever.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Every birthday I miss is a year of my boy's life I'll never get back. And this year, every Gol I had went into expanding the business. There's nothing left to buy him a gift.}}

*''I could loan you the money.''
*''Maybe I could build him something.''
*''You could make him something.''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I could loan you the money.
|That's super generous of you, but you've already done a lot for me, and I don't want to take advantage of our friendship. I appreciate the offer though.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|But maybe...if it's not too much trouble, could you make him something for me? It would have to be on the train soon to get to him on time.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Maybe I could build him something.
|That would be amazing. Are you sure you don't mind? It would have to be on the train soon to get it to him on time.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=You could make him something.
|I'm not much good at that sort of thing. I once tried to make a cuddly toy bear for Alo when he was a baby. When I turned it right side out to fill it with stuffing, the head was on backwards.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''I'm happy to help.''
*''Too much on my plate.''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I'm happy to help.
|Really? Oh thank you! You're the best! What would I do without you?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I've been thinking about what to give him. Ma said in her last letter that Alo's become obsessed with trains. Last year it was Yakmel ranching. Now, he wants to be a conductor.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|Jensen collects models of trains. Maybe he has some recipes he can share with us. Alo would love a model train.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|Alright, let's do this, I'll ask Jensen and see if he'll lend me a recipe. I'll let you know as soon as I've got anything!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Too much on my plate.
|I understand. You do a lot around here without having to bail me out of every jam. It did give me some ideas, though. I'll ask Mi-an. I don't know why I didn't think about it before.}}
