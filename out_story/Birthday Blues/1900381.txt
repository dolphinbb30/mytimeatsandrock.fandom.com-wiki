{{dialogue|Jensen|Y'know, many folks can't tell the difference between a TR43 and a FT904, heck, one time I saw someone confuse a FT904 for a C3 Delta! Hahaha! C3 Delta! With those boarding lights? Hehe, whoo, that was a good one.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Haha... yeah the Delta... The colors are beautiful though.}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Well, I used a muted palatte to try and get a realistic finish. The markings on the passenger entry door really distinguish the TR43. The details make the model. But for a beginner? I'd recommend the RX428!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Huh? Those two aren't any good?}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Not any good? The TR43 and the FT904 are some of the most beautiful trains to hit the tracks! Function, form. Perfect union. But it's a complex kit. I'd say it's probably one of the most difficult assemblies.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Sounds like a lot of trouble to put on the Builder...}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Hehe, well for anyone with some experience building, it's a pleasure.}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Ah, here's a doozy! The PE777. Now there's a machine... 1:43 scale, impeccable detail, wow, a piece of history that one.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Seven seven, seven... got it.}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Unfortunately, her brakes weren't quite up to the task of reining her in. She kept overshooting the stations and had to back up to let folks disembark properly.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|So Jensen, this PE777, do you have the recipe for it?}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|You uh... you wanna go with the 777? You know, the 779-}}
{{dialogue|Catori|No, it's perfect. Alo's lucky number is 7, he'll just love it!}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Hahaha! Well, different spokes for different folks, eh? Here. This is one of my favorites. I'm sure your son will be thrilled with it.}}
