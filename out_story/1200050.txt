{{dialogue|Yan|Oh, it's you again.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Say, since I've got you: did I ever explain the {{textcolor|green|Commission Board}} to you?}}

*''No, how does it work? <color=#ffc64c>【Tutorial】}}''
*''I'll figure it out myself.''

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=I'll figure it out myself.
|Ah hah! Dedicated to figuring it out yourself, eh? Well, good on you! The less time I have to spend training you, the more time I'll have for... you know, big important president stuff!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|I think you'll find all the information you need in the {{textcolor|green|Commerce Guild Handbook on my desk}}. Check it out if there's something you're not getting. Ciao!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Whew. Alright, then newbie, listen up! 'Cause I don't wanna have to repeat myself...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|The most important commissions that I'll need you to do- well, don't you worry about that, I'll make sure you know about those! Rocky's Crane Lift, for example...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|But for everything else, there's the {{textcolor|green|Commission Board inside the Guild}}!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Townsfolk post less urgent commissions there! Nevertheless, you should still pick up those right away! Good for you, good for the Guild!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Each commission gets a Star Rating, one star means it's easy, five stars means it's for pros only! Wanna feel the glory and reap the rewards of Five Star commissions? Gotta start at the bottom and build up your {{textcolor|green|Workshop Equipment and Reputation}}!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Since you're a newbie, you can only take one per day. Finish it up quick, then pick up a new commission the next day. As you raise your Star Rating, you'll be able to take on multiple commissions per day!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|At the end of the year, we here at the Guild count up who's been doing what around town and divvy out awards to the top performers! The rewards for taking first place are pretty sweet...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Er, but I wouldn't concern yourself with that so much, I mean, I've never lost, haha!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Well, that about does it. Got everything?}}

*''Yep. Got it.''
*''No, can you repeat all that?''

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Yep. Got it.
|reward={{NPC2|Yan|rp=10}}|That's good, newbie! You listen to speeches well! I daresay you have middle-management written all over you! See you around!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=No, can you repeat all that?
|What!? Seriously?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|reward={{NPC2|Yan|rp=10}}|Go to the {{textcolor|green|Commission Board}} everyday, get a commission, build the thing, give the thing to the person who commissioned it, get money. That's it! That's literally it! Ok, you've got it. Check the {{textcolor|green|book on my desk}} if you still have questions. Now, go go go!}}
