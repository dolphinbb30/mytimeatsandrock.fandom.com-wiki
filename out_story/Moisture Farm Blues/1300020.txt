Title: Civil Corps Catch Cans
It's been quite inspiring to see those from all walks of life to be able to contribute to the local Food Drive in some way; after some spelunking by Justice and his deputy in training, the Sandrock Civil Corps stumbled upon an undiscovered pocket of ruins deep within Paradise Lost: of all things, an Age of Darkness camp that had been holding a food drive of their own. Inside, not everything was salvagable, but they did find one thousand cans of peaches. 

Based on language deciphered on the cans, the peaches are infused with advanced Old World preservatives and expected to expire 400 years from now, giving the Corps plenty of time to distribute them throughout the Eufaula. "I hope y'all like peaches," said Justice on the discovery.

Title: Donations Distributed Dancefully, Fiasco Fleetingly Forgotten
Yesterday marked the successful end of the very first Sandrock Food Drive Dance-off. Local Sandrockers as well as those from nearby surrounding areas all showed out in full force, putting on display a powerful mix of generosity and style.

All manners of donations found their way to the food drive box; Minister Matilda of the Church had this to say: "We had hardly dreamed that so many kind-hearted people would find their way into our little town and have so much to offer. I would like to thank everyone who lent a helping hand, big or small, from the bottom of my heart. It is with your support that Sandrock yet goes on."

Local cook Owen, upon checking through the ingredients offered to him by way of the donation box weighed in, "So, to the people out there who donated Sandworms... Were you really that desperate? Or are there people out there who want to know if I can make Sandworms taste good?"

The scene of the Dance-off was just as lively, as even some of our more senior citizens showed up to boast the effects of all the dietary supplements that most would simply roll their eyes at, finally reaching a crescendo as local conductor, Jensen, led many in a conga line of laudable length. "I can dance all day, I'll waltz your face off in 5/4!" bellowed a clearly winded Hugo. "And Heidi, if you get a minute, can you go tell Matilda that we really need more water bottles stationed around the stage? I'm workin' up a bit of a sweat," he quickly added.

Owner of the Wandering Y Ranch, Cooper, then aggresively made himself available for interview: "Now, y'all know me, I'm about as progressive as can be but let's be honest with ourselves: this new-fangled kinda dance moves ain't really cuttin' it. I think we can all agree, everything was better back when it was old school, underground. I, of course, am referring to the dances of the Age of Darkness! Break-Charleston it was called! See, people at the time were tryin' to pick up the pieces of what it was to dance, and they simply combined the most palatable styles they were able to re-discover..." (For the purposes of paper conservation, the rest of this quote has been redacted.)

In summary, this Food Drive Dance-off showed off the unity and indomitable spirit of the citizens of Sandrock. As we patiently await the result of our local Builders working on Moisture Farm repairs, our morale is high, and our hearts full of hope.

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|We really need to think of a way to deal with those Geeglers once and for all. I might go find the Mayor and come up with a plan...}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I could put an end to this whole Geegle conflict, honest! I just need time to learn their language! Sss ss ss ss! I think that means, "I come in peace!"}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Taking the initiative to strike the Geeglers? What will the headlines tell, I wonder. "Sandrock pits together and drives away the Geegler forces," or "Sandrock falls in a day; Geeglers strike, town unprepared."}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I think I might have to ask Owen for a raise. All this Geegler nonsense surely warrants some form of hazard pay.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Why would the Geeglers be picking apart our bridge? Are they planning something? Are they... capable of planning something?}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Only solace I take in times like these is that it's a good time for sellin' weapons. You'd do well to arm yourself, Builder. Never know when you might need to defend yourself again.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Are you gonna fight the lizardmen? Watch out for their tails! If I was a lizard, I'd whack people with my tail... I wish I had a tail.}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Well, on the bright side, at least the train to Highwind will still be running.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Have I got a plan? Have I got a plan? Heh... 'Course I got a plan! It's the best dang plan this side of the Eufaula! I just gotta hammer out a few details... Say, you don't have any other ideas, do you?}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|It's always good to drive them lizard folk away, there's always the worry they're gonna come bother us again. It's like I said to our Rocky, we gotta have our wits about us, right Builda?}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|This whole Geegler altercation has really got Cooper wound up. I sure hope everything is gonna be alright...}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Don't worry, dear, we're not gonna get pushed out of our home by a bunch of overgrown mutants! Our Civil Corps is going to handle this mess, and then everything is going to be back to normal.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Whew. It's been a rough start for us, huh? Well, things can't get any worse, right? I'm sure once this Geegler thing is handled, Sandrock will be back on track!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|We Sandrockers are used to crisis. It's a shame things have escalated so quickly since your arrival but... well, welcome to the show. Stay strong, Builder.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Fight with nature and nature will fight back; taking such a hotblooded approach to this situation, it'll just lead things back to where they always go...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Maybe if I just made the perfect dish specially designed for lizard tastebuds? Ahhhh, shucks. I hate it when violence really is the answer.}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Let's round up a posse to teach those Geeglers a lesson, partners! Haha, it's so camp, I love it.}}
