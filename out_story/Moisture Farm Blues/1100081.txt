If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|It's good to hear that most of Zeke's crops are recovering; just goes to show you the resilience of nature. Hm, I wonder if we can learn from their example?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Phew, I'm glad I didn't order a lot of produce from elsewhere. I didn't really expect you Builders to fix the farm so quickly, but I had a feelin', you know.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I heard about the Hydrogel! Thank the Light, we can start eating right again! I'll have to stop in to help out ol' Zeke some time... That's right! Don't think you're the only one running the telesis game in this town!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Real glad you handled that Hydrogel situation. I was starting to doubt my decision to come to Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|All's well that ends well I always say. I just hope ol' Zeke has learned his lesson. Can't trust them Geeglers as far as you can throw 'em! Er... well, in Zeke's case, maybe that's a, er, metaphor that quickly falls apart... Well, suffice to say: lizard men bad!}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Woah, thanks for all the hard work, ''Player''! The Moisture Farm was damaged real bad this time, I helped Zeke have a look at it recently, but I still had a few concerns. Looks like your new Hydrogel has addressed a lot, though!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Hey, I heard you fixed the 'ol farm! Nice going! I'm goin Yakmel ridin' to commemorate this fine occasion, yeehaw!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Phew, thanks for fixing the farm! This is the first time in my life I haven't had easy and instant access to fresh food and vegetables; honestly, I'm rather parched.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Everything's back on the menu at the Blue Moon, and yet, we've had even fewer customers than usual. I'm afraid it's my cooking...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey ''Player'', you should have consulted me on the structural integrity of Zeke's moisture machine before making repairs, you know, just in case. But... good job anyway!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Hey, I stopped by Zeke's farm just a bit ago: you and Mi-an really spruced the place up; you can barely tell it was ransacked! Nice work.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Heidi said we can have extra veggies tonight and it's all because of you! Thank you, ''Player''! No, I didn't really mean it. I shouldn't lie.}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Hopefully things will be a lot more safe around here now that the Geeglers know that we'll just rebuild anything they destroy! ...You don't think... they'd never do anything to my trains, would they?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Hey, ''Player''. We've changed our patrols in a way that should give the moisture farm more adequate coverage; you won't be seein' anymore Geeglers over there if we have anything to say 'bout it!}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|I heard you repaired the Moisture Farm. That's wicked good Builda! If Pebbles can be as good as you in the future, well that'd be just great. I mean, it's gonna be tough for him to match up to his Pa, so you're a good compromise!}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Finally! Zeke's greenhouse is right as rain! I can hardly help myself waitin' for the veggies to grow; between you and me, the family's gettin' sick and tired of rutabaga stew every night.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Zeke's moisture farm is such an important part of keeping Sandrock going... We're so lucky that you Builders were able to take care of everything so swimmingly! Are you sure your middle name isn't 'Telesis?'}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I've been farming with Zeke a lot recently! I'm exhausted, covered in manure, and smell absolutely repulsive. I love it!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Your contribution to the Hydrogel during these trying times will not go unnoted: well done, Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|I heard you fixed that Old World machine of Zeke's, keeping us from famine... So it's true. Each age brings forth genius on this noble land, and so shall each rule its own domain... until the next...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Hey, great job on the Hydrogel! You and Mi-an are already pulling your weight; really glad to know we can count on you guys when things get tough.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I heard you fixed things at Zeke's farm. I guess that means there will be plenty of fresh crops soon. And just when I was acquiring a taste for Burgess's signature style mush...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I trust the Hydrogel is operating flawlessly? Wait, don't answer that, I know my designs are flawless.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|All I wanted was a few days of rest, but Dan-dan woke me up every day so she could go help the Moisture Farm. I heard you've fixed up all up now though, right? "The hard days are over, now comes the rain," that's "The Thankful Afterlife." I swear, they have something for every situation, pal.}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Me an' my boys heard about you fixin' up that farm equipment. That thing that takes moisture outta the air... How do you even make somethin' that complicated?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Hey, I saw the farm. You did some real good building, friend. I guess that's why you're the Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|I told Hugo he ought to go and help out with Zeke's farm, but he kept makin' excuses like, "That's not my job, Ma! It's for the Builders to sort out!" Phooey! I didn't raise my boy to be a slacker!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|I just found out that you made a Hydrogel without anyone submitting an official commission request! You think you're some kinda loose cannon who doesn't play by the rules? I'll let this one slide, but you're on thin ice, buddy... Thin ice!}}
