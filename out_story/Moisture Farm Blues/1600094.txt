Title: Builder Battles Beasts Beneath Breach!
The Breach!  A mysterious Old World tower believed to have once been some kind of office building, an area once known for its rich relic deposits, now closed because of Civil Corps suspicions of danger sprouting up within; who could've known how right they were...?

Just the day before the publication of this article, Workshop Owner, ''Player'', went into The Breach in search of necessary components involving the ongoing food shortage crisis. It was there that the Builder not only encountered some of the rogue AI that are par for the course around these parts, but further down, it was revealed that The Breach was harboring a secret gathering site belonging to none other than the troublesome Geegler lizardmen! 

Cool under pressure, ''Player'' managed to heroically repel the Geegler scavenging party and block the path by which they were infiltrating the Breach, demonstrating impressive fighting ability and razor sharp wit!

Sheriff Justice of the Civil Corps had this to say on the matter: "I mean, nobody could've ever expected something like this, I mean... to get in there, like, what, did they dig a tunnel all the way down the canyon then up again or somethin'!? We were just about to go in and look for ''Player'', so, uh, really they were never in any danger at all. We'll be headed in today to reinforce that barrier and check around for other threats, and uh... ''Player'', if you're reading this: Hope everything's cool." 

Ignoring such a dubious segue, speaking of ''Player'', and... speaking of cool...! While exploring The Breach, ''Player'' found a Condensor! A rare device used for turning air into water through the process of cooling, see how I brought all that together?  

In any case, this reporter brings that up as a Condensor is an essential piece of the Moisture Farm's Hydrogel; finding such a relic is a good sign that a turn around at the farm, and the end of our food crisis, is just around the corner!

Stay strong out there, Sandrockers.

Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|I hope the food drive is a success. Arvio and I will be donating as much as we can afford.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|You may have to watch out for me at the dance-off, ''Player''! We Barnarockers are known for our good sense of rhythm, don't you know?}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|I'm so very excited for the dance-off! So glad that the Minister and Owen came up with the food drive idea as well! I continue to believe the Light will guide us in tough trials like this.}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Hah... A food-drive dance-off? You folks really think that's what's gonna bring the masses in? I've tried a million ideas a thousand times better than that already and...  er...You don't think it's really gonna work, do you, ''Player''?}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Yep, it's like I always say. Want people to show up to your food drive? Better have a dance-off. Feel that, Builder? It's the fire of competitive spirit, present in the heart of every true Sandrocker. On the subject of the dance-off, I recommend that you be there, or be square.}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I mean, donating food is good an' all, but I don't really understand what it's got to do with dancing. Maybe Minister Matilda has her own reasons, but for me it's just a good reason to grow more food!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I just hope there's enough foodstuffs to go around at the dance-off to keep me in fightin' condition. I reckon my moves wouldn't hold up too well against a well-fed tourist on an empty stomach... I'm too young to get served!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|In the face of a food crisis, the people of Sandrock banded together to bring sweet relief to their troubles. Both at once, a solution, and a release. Hard work, and pleasure. Insipiring, but I fear there is a lack of... intrigue. A twist is needed, perhaps?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Never a dull moment around here. "We're running out of food so let's have a food drive, but also: make it a dance battle." Oooookay!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|I just hope our dance-off ends up being better than the dances during school in Atara; it was all the boys glued to one side of the hall and all the girls glued to the other.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|You know, for all the time I spent behind the keyboard, I never did learn how to dance. Y'all have fun, now. And don't try to pull me up on stage or nothin'... Cuz that's not my thang.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|The first ever Sandrock dance festival is happening! What a time to be alive!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I heard about the dance-off. The only dance I know how to do is the conga-line dance, but... if everyone else is doing it, maybe I'll try!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|I gotta do some huntin' to do my fair share for the food drive. Hey, Builder: random question: would you eat a Bumble Ant? I mean, cooked first, obviously.}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Forget the fundraiser, I'm a crazy good dancer. I used to be on the dancin' team! Whenever it's time, Rocky can take care of Pebbles, I'mma show off my moves!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|My Cooper plays a mean guitar, but when it comes to dancin', he's got two left feet! I just hope he don't embarass Elsie too much at the dance-off...}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|No matter what happens, nothin' can ever break the Sandrock spirit! When things get low, we go high! Food supply dwindlin'? We'll have a dance-off. Runnin' out of water? Heck, let's turn it into a parade!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|A dance-off, huh? I'm good with dancing until I make eye contact with someone. Then I feel awkward and have to stop. Maybe a little Yakmel Milk would take the edge off...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Though I find our plan to have a dance competition puerile and hardly a solution to our problems, I admit that it is important to keep the masses entertained in times of trouble.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|And so, when times grow dark, we again shine bright. However, a fire burns strongest just before it's about to be snuffed out.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|To tell you the truth, I've been wantin' to have a dance-off for ages. This just seemed like the perfect excuse!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Dance is one of the purest forms of expression; this "dance-off" undermines that by turning an artform into a competition. And can we really not get any classier music around here? No offense to the bumpkin band, or whatever they call themselves...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Dancing is an exercise in strength, stamina, and finesse! The muscle control required for a passably stylish jig is the very same that makes me untouchable in combat! This dance-off will be a day of reckoning... I shall unleash boogie "justice" upon this land without mercy!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|The dance-off... self-invoking body spasms to the temporal rhythms produced by soundwaves of varying frequencies. How utterly meaningless.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|A food drive? Dance off? Ha, I dunno pal, it's not really my thing. I just wanted a day off...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Yeah, I heard about the dance-off. I know howta do the monkey. I know howta do the mashed potato. That should be enough to win I'm thinkin'. You enterin'?}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|A dance-off? I don't really get it. I've never danced before. Willingly.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I'm afraid my dancin' days are behind me, but I can cook up a whole mess of pasta to dish out on the day of the festival. That'll be my way of "droppin' it while it's hot!"}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Now, no one hates being a buzzkill more than me, but I'm afraid I have to recommend not participating in the dance-off. Save your strength for commissions! No? Hm, well just don't let me see you getting behind in your work, got it?}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|I mean, havin' a dance-off ain't gonna make crops grow any better. Surely... Surely, I'm not the only one who knows that...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Thank you. Ahem. Last night I sat down with Miguel and the Minister and did a rough inventory estimation of all the food we have in stock in and around Sandrock. It turns out we actually have enough food, probably, to last for a bit. But it's unevenly distributed.}}

Title: Civil Corps Catch Cans
It's been quite inspiring to see those from all walks of life to be able to contribute to the local Food Drive in some way; after some spelunking by Justice and his deputy in training, the Sandrock Civil Corps stumbled upon an undiscovered pocket of ruins deep within Paradise Lost: of all things, an Age of Darkness camp that had been holding a food drive of their own. Inside, not everything was salvagable, but they did find one thousand cans of peaches. 

Based on language deciphered on the cans, the peaches are infused with advanced Old World preservatives and expected to expire 400 years from now, giving the Corps plenty of time to distribute them throughout the Eufaula. "I hope y'all like peaches," said Justice on the discovery.

Title: Donations Distributed Dancefully, Fiasco Fleetingly Forgotten
Yesterday marked the successful end of the very first Sandrock Food Drive Dance-off. Local Sandrockers as well as those from nearby surrounding areas all showed out in full force, putting on display a powerful mix of generosity and style.

All manners of donations found their way to the food drive box; Minister Matilda of the Church had this to say: "We had hardly dreamed that so many kind-hearted people would find their way into our little town and have so much to offer. I would like to thank everyone who lent a helping hand, big or small, from the bottom of my heart. It is with your support that Sandrock yet goes on."

Local cook Owen, upon checking through the ingredients offered to him by way of the donation box weighed in, "So, to the people out there who donated Sandworms... Were you really that desperate? Or are there people out there who want to know if I can make Sandworms taste good?"

The scene of the Dance-off was just as lively, as even some of our more senior citizens showed up to boast the effects of all the dietary supplements that most would simply roll their eyes at, finally reaching a crescendo as local conductor, Jensen, led many in a conga line of laudable length. "I can dance all day, I'll waltz your face off in 5/4!" bellowed a clearly winded Hugo. "And Heidi, if you get a minute, can you go tell Matilda that we really need more water bottles stationed around the stage? I'm workin' up a bit of a sweat," he quickly added.

Owner of the Wandering Y Ranch, Cooper, then aggresively made himself available for interview: "Now, y'all know me, I'm about as progressive as can be but let's be honest with ourselves: this new-fangled kinda dance moves ain't really cuttin' it. I think we can all agree, everything was better back when it was old school, underground. I, of course, am referring to the dances of the Age of Darkness! Break-Charleston it was called! See, people at the time were tryin' to pick up the pieces of what it was to dance, and they simply combined the most palatable styles they were able to re-discover..." (For the purposes of paper conservation, the rest of this quote has been redacted.)

In summary, this Food Drive Dance-off showed off the unity and indomitable spirit of the citizens of Sandrock. As we patiently await the result of our local Builders working on Moisture Farm repairs, our morale is high, and our hearts full of hope.
