Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|It's amazing to me the lengths some will go to harm others. Such an elaborate scheme unfurled right under our noses... I hope all those criminals get everything they deserve...}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Well, I hope everybody learned at least one lesson out of all this... Never mess with bandits! We're sure to expose criminals in a way that maximizes bravado and scrutiny in the public eye! Miguel's villain career will never recover from this...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|What an awful, terrible, no good scheme those baddies baked up! Now I know those in cake houses shouldn't throw icing, but... I mean, none of my dumb plans were ever that dumb! ...Right?}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Oh, hey, ''Player''... Sorry, I'm kind of going through a lot of stuff right now. One of the people I looked up to most has been shot, and another turned out to be pure evil. But enough about me. What's new with you?}}

{{dialogue|Catori|All's well that ends well. And there's no such thing as bad publicity! Sandrock'll be in every paper in the Free Cities pretty soon... Ah, what's that look for? Yeah, okay, I'm bad. Church lady will be fine, everything will be fine... I'm sorry...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Course, I always knew Logan was still on our side. In fact I suspected an even deeper conspiracy, thus the grounds for my seemingly complicit nature. I was tryin' to work my way into the cabal... and I was this close! Til you went and solved the mystery like five minutes before I could. So. Congrats. I guess...}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|It's... hard times at the Church of the Light right now. We used to be such a big happy family...! Or so I thought. Now we're a... sad... confused, small family. Thank the Light Matilda is pulling through, I really don't know what we'd do without her.}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|It's like I've been sayin' all along, Logan's innocent! Even the water tower thing that seemed completely impossible for him to have not done... I was right about that, too! Remember this, next time yer pickin' lottery numbers...}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|So Logan turned out to be one of the good ones? Hm... I'd planned to have him go down in a blaze of glory in my novel... Maybe I still can... Maybe it's even better that way...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|This town... is full of secrets...}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I know you're not really the talkative type, but I really don't know how you could resist throwing in just ooone little quip after beating up Pen. "Who's the Skinny Arms now, eh!?" I dunno, something like that...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|I always had my suspicions about your old boss, Yan, but... Miguel always seemed like he really believed in the Church of the Light teachings. I wonder where it all went so wrong...?}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|I always felt pretty sideways about Logan runnin' off... turns out it was me who was too quick to give up on him. Now I feel... upside down.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Pen tried to take a shot at my Ma. Remember that, ''Player''. I certainly will...}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Yes, I'm glad to be able to once again call Logan a friend, but he did still give my passengers a real scare way back when! So... I don't know... I guess I'm advocating for a... fine? Nothing serious. Maybe I really just want an apology!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Whew. Civil Corp's lookin' not so great right now. Well, except for you. Us other guys let a lot fly under the radar for far too long... Oh, uh... you're deputy now for sure. If you wanna be. Heck, you can be sheriff, too...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Better late than never with that whole water stealing debacle; I say it's all been a net positive. My Rocky's been on cloud nine ever since he got to whack that stupid mop salesman into next week, not to mention- Er... Yeah he's a lot... happier in general...}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I'm so glad Logan's back, and he was always one of us! I just... can't believe it happened like this. I hope nothin' ever comes between us Sandrockers ever again. My heart just can't take it!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Hnngh... Ah...}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|So you were sneaking around, uncovering mysteries, foiling villainous plots, all under the veil of moonlight, unbeknownst to our fair town? Can you pleaaaase take me next time? You know I live for that kind of stuff!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Leave me, ''Player''. We have nothing more to discuss...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|To think... we had always thought nature would be our greatest adversary. But in the end, the last of our obstacles would be... human nature...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|That's the power of persuasion... Miguel and that silver tongue of his turned me against an old friend... Fooled all of us. I hope Logan can forgive me. It'll be especially tough considering he's not the kind of guy who can be won over with spaghetti...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|You don't suspect me of being a Duvos spy, do you? Aha, darling, I couldn't keep such a secret to save my life! ...No one actually suspects me, right...?}}

{{dialogue|Pen|No fair, Skinny! You and your stupid gang ganged up on me! C'mon and let me out... You're a true warrior, fight me like one! Mano e mano! C'mon... I know you wanna...!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Unfortunately, I was unable to intuit the nature of the water stealing contraption, as wiring pipes through the Peach statue is so utterly asinine that no sane mind could ever imagine it being a possibility. Glad you stumbled into their rather sinister plot.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|I can't believe no one did anything about Miguel and Yan for so long. I mean, I can believe I didn't do anything but, I mean... the rest of these guys? C'mon.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Hey there, ''Player''! The birds are singin', the sun is shinin', and the sky is just a little bluer now that I finally got to take that mopstick bam, zoom, straight to the moon! I think... I might never be sad again!}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I'm sorry I let things get so out of hand at that "trial..." Miguel... he really had us wrapped around his finger. Thank you, ''Player''. Thank you for helping get to the bottom of all this...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I'm going to really miss chasing Logan. I mean. That's all we used to do. I'm trying to find a new hobby, but it's hard filling all this newly freed up time that still feels like Logan chasing time...}}

{{dialogue|Venti|Wow, they were hiding water all along!? I can't believe it! I really owe Logan an apology! Peck lost his wallet the other day, and I was sure that Logan took it! Turns out he just threw it out by accident...}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|The pup is finally back in the pack! What a pleasant turn of events, Logan being good all along. And the whuppin' I'd planned on giving him has been reduced from "severe" to "mild." Good news all around!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Miguel always did kinda rub me the wrong way back in my church days. But... I didn't want to be rude... Sometimes it is best to be impolite, I guess...}}
