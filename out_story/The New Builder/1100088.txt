{{dialogue|Yan|Now that's a nice lookin' Pickhammer! It is the soul of a desert Builder, never lose it... but if you do, now you know how to build another one, I suppose.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Next, let me tell you about the {{textcolor|green|Recycler}}! It's another indispensable tool for a desert Builder. It's the machine that's synonymous with: "make do."}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Once it's made, you can put the {{textcolor|green|scrap}} you collect with your {{textcolor|green|Pickhammer}} into the {{textcolor|green|Recycler}} to get all kinds of useful items.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|You can construct the Recycler on your {{textcolor|green|Assembly Station}}. Here's the diagram for it, just look it up in your {{textcolor|green|Workshop Handbook}}. You can also open to it on the {{textcolor|green|control panel}} at the Assembly Station.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Hey, there you are! No, no need to show me the Recycler. I'm sure it's fine. You have a Builder's License, right? Besides, what's the worst it could do? Explode and burn our whole town to the ground? Hahaha! Ha...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|The main thing to take away here is that from now on, whenever you have questions, you can just consult your Workshop Handbook and definitely not ask me anything related to building whatsoever; yes, I'll be far, far too busy to handle your questions...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|So now that you have the basic knowledge of a desert Builder, why don't you mosey on over to {{textcolor|green|City Hall}} and register your workshop.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Normally the mayor handles registrations, but {{textcolor|green|Minister Matilda}} is taking over administrative type stuff for her at the moment.}}

*''Where's the mayor?''
*''Okay, got it.''

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Where's the mayor?
|Oh, you hadn't heard? She's off trying to plant things in the Eufaula Desert. Puh! Didn't no-one ever tell her plants need dirt to grow!? ... Say, she's been gone for a while... I sure hope she's still alive!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Okay, got it.
|Mindlessly following orders, alright! You're my kinda Builder!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Oh, by the way! I found a couple of {{textcolor|green|extra diagrams}} I was probably going to throw away- er... but why would I do that when I could just recycle them... to you! No need to thank me! Consider it a new employee bonus... thingy!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Anyway, hurry over to {{textcolor|green|City Hall}} and have {{textcolor|green|Matilda}} register your workshop. While you're out, I'll be preparing a job for ya. Hurry back when you're registered!}}
