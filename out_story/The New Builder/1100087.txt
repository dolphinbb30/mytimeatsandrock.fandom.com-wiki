{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hm... Kind of slim pickings... but at least he did leave you a {{textcolor|green|Worktable}}. That should be all you need to make a {{textcolor|green|Pickhammer}}!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|You know, Sandrock is still well-known across all the Free Cities for being directly on top of an Old World metropolis. They say some old scraps even end up here on the surface when the wind blows.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Once we have our Pickhammers, we can smash 'em up and get all the resources we need!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Also I kinda wanted to say something to you privately. Uhmm... see, the reason I came to Sandrock is because it's not doing so well for itself. Everybody in the Free Cities knows that. But I didn't hesitate signing that contract.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I thought it'd be the best way for me to make a difference in the world. I bet you feel the same way. So let's make a promise, Builder to Builder. {{textcolor|green|Let's take Sandrock back to its glory days during our time here. Let's give it our all, okay?}}}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Whew! Well, I'm off to make my Pickhammer! See you around!}}
