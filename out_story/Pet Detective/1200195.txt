Title: Costumed Criminal Caught!
"Eat marbles, marble eaters!" Famous last words.

Last words before being caught, that is! Was that enough of a hook? See for a second there, maybe you thought... Oh, alright, maybe that wasn't a great thing to do. Sorry for misleading you, but we put out a survey and apparently more than half of our readers don't make it more than halfway down the page! So, yeah. Just trying to make things more exciting.

Anyway, ''Player'' caught a bandit!

Oh, maybe that was a better hook. But in any case, yes, it's true. Apparently upon receiving a highly dubious commission, ''Player'' hit the streets looking for clues leading to the revelation of the specialist's true identity and subsequent capture! Bravo, ''Player''! 

Our hard-boiled Builder detective had this to say on the matter:

"It all stank to high heaven. I could see trouble written all over his face, and had a feeling he couldn't even spell the word if he was lookin' at it in the mirror. He fancied himself a wolf in sheep's clothing, but when he opened his mouth all I could hear was 'baa baa baa...'"

Or at least, that's what I'd expect to hear. Everyone thinks in metaphors when they're solving crimes! Unfortunately ''Player'' was not available for comment, and, well... Sorry, ''Player''! We have to get this news out while it's still hot!

Andy, the bandit boy is safely in the hands of the Civil Corps, and it is planned that he will be sent to work for the Church until he can be rehabilitated.

We eagerly await the arrival of the real specialist. Stay tuned to the Tumbleweed Standard for more updates on these situations. Are you still reading? Yay! Article's over now, thanks for reading!

Title: Getting to Know Bronco the Kid: How a Seemingly Bad Thing was not Actually a Good Thing and was, as it Initially Seemed, a Bad Thing
Following up on our previous article: "The Specialist and You: How a Seemingly Bad Thing is Actually a Good Thing;" now that said specialist has actually arrived, let's look at the ongoing situation and how it might be affecting you, the reader. Are things as bad as they seem? Short answer, "yes."

First off, let's hear it from the man in his own words... Who is Bronco the Kid?

"I am the law," he began. He stood there for a good thirty seconds or so squinting at me and protruding his jaw slightly. Once it was clear he was not going to elaborate, I decided to go for a follow up. "What do you... mean by that exactly?" I asked.

"I am the night. I am darkness. I the one who answers the call... Whenever a little old lady needs help crossing the street, I'll be there. Whenever candy is taken from a baby, I'll be there. Whenever the ice cream machine at a late night diner is very suspiciously said to be broken when it looks totally fine, I'll be there, too!"

No doubt you too have been victim to one of Bronco's numerous inane and unnecessarily invasive traffic stops, as well as heard similar speeches that also go nowhere and are just oozing with delusions of grandeur. Due to multiple complaints, as of this writing, Bronco's authority to detain citizens will shortly be revoked which... should really come as no surprise to anyone.

Bronco's contract includes a clause that promises he will 'capture his target or die trying,' so... expect to see a lot more of him. But do feel free to report him to City Hall if he's acting up again.

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Anyway! After doing a bit of surveying in town, there's one thing I'm absolutely certain of... there is a spy in Sandrock.}}

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|And the worst part... everyone is a suspect. Even you. I'm going out on a limb for you, citizen. Don't make me regret it.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|I actually did send letters to several citizens, but you're the only one that showed up, so far. That makes them extra suspicious.}}
