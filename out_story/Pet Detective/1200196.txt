{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Citizen! Welcome! I had a feeling you'd have no trouble finding my secret hideout; I've heard good things about you.}}

*''This is a hotel room.''
*''Wow, nice hideout, my guy.''

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=This is a hotel room.
|Indeed it is, my astute associate!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Wow, nice hideout, my guy.
|Indubitably!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|What better place to hide, than in plain sight...?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Anyway! After doing a bit of surveying in town, there's one thing I'm absolutely certain of... there is a spy in Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|That's right, a mole, a double agent, a spy! Someone is relaying information to the Logan Gang from inside Sandrock... and who knows what kind of diabolical mischief they could accomplish with such a connection!?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|And the worst part... everyone is a suspect. Even you. I'm going out on a limb for you, citizen. Don't make me regret it.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|I actually did send letters to several citizens, but you're the only one that showed up, so far. That makes them extra suspicious.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Now, I have only been able to clear a select few inhabitants of the town of any suspicion. Indeed, the only people we can trust are not people at all! We require the assistance from none other than...}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|...The pets of Sandrock.}}

*''Of course.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''The pets?'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|That's right. They're the only ones who have nothing to gain by speaking with Logan. And that's where you come in, citizen.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|These pets...they can be bought. We need to catch some sandfish and get some dog food, then use those to coax the pets over to our side; the side of truth and justice! I'm setting up my feng shui compass, so I'll need your help for that.}}

*''I won't let you down, sir.''
*''I can't believe how ridiculous this is!''

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=I won't let you down, sir.
|That's what I like to hear.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=I can't believe how ridiculous this is!
|The only thing ridiculous about it is how long it took me to come up with the idea!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|And think of it this way, believe in me who believes in myself. Just listen to what I have to say!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Once you've gained your targets' trust, ask them if they've noticed any suspicious behavior around town.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Good luck, citizen. Find me when you've accomplished your part of the mission. Now back to my feng shui compass and...}}
