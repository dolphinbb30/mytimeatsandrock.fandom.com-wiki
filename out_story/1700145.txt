Title: Crane Couple Construction Complete!
Breaking Sandrock Commerce Guild records for most outstanding commission (outstanding meaning: remaining to be paid, done, or dealt with), fledgling Builders Mi-an and ''Player'' have finished their first big job by assembling and installing two fabulous and functional cranes above the Paradise Lost ruins. These cranes will allow the salvagers of Eufaula Salvage to dig deeper into the Paradise Lost ruins where untold treasures may yet lie!

Rocky, the boss of the salvage company had this to say: "We had mostly exhausted the good relics on the levels we had access to, in fact, now that I think about it, it makes me kinda mad that it took so long to get this done!" He then abruptly ended the interview and began smashing nearby rocks and debris with near-superhuman agility.

The construction of these cranes and the bolstering of Eufaula Salvage's operations spell good news for Sandrock's economy and inspire hope for all of us.

Title: Ne'er-do-well Nabs Nada
Logan has struck again! But, in a surprising turn of events, this time he's guilty of... nothing!

Well, not exactly nothing, he did cause quite the ruckus by forcefully boarding a train and did give a few visitors to our town quite the scare! And he did also break a window!

"We ended up arriving at the station 30 minutes late! Now, I didn't have any appointments, but can you just imagine if I did?!" said arriving tourist, Rhok.

What could it all mean? Is Logan finally settling down? Or is just the beginning of something far more sinister? There's no evidence suggesting that Logan is biding his time, preparing some sort of devastating tactic to destroy all of Sandrock, but there also isn't any evidence suggesting he isn't!

Sorry to alarm all you folks out there with such unfounded scare tactics, but we did some numbers and found out that we sell a lot more papers if we do. So, yeah. Don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already to the Tumbleweed Standard!

Title: Gaggle of Geeglers Give Out Garbage!
It was a somber and unsuspecting morning. The sun had just begun to peek out over the horizon, sending a shimmer of light across the dewed desert, quickly crawling its way into our oasis, erupting with illumination to bring to the citizens of Sandrock a brand new day, full of possibilities, until... calamity struck.

"It was horrible!" an anonymous bystander described, "I was just watering the petunias like I do every day, and before I know it, somehow I've been transported to some kind of landfill-themed warzone!"

Debris and unmentionables began to rain from the sky, aimed at citizens in the area, landing all about and even in the waters of the oasis. The party perpetrating this preposterous precipitation: the Geeglers. 

Not much is known about the Geeglers; they have long since been making trouble throughout the Eufaula, but up until recently had never been so bold as to cross the Shonash Bridge into Sandrock city limits, much less take direct action against our citizens. Fortunately, much of the would-be damage was curtailed by none other than our very own Civil Corps. 

"I really wish them dang Geeglers would find somethin' better to do. They can write their names all over the place, would stand to reason they could just read a book or somethin'," mused Justice, shortly after chasing off the filth flinging fiends.

No one was harmed during the attack, but since the event, Civil Corps patrols will be increased, and city officials have recommended that the Geeglers status as a nuisance be upgraded to 'threat.' The self-proclaimed enforcer and 'Protector of Sandrock,' Pen, insisted on the last word: "Tell them to bring it on!"

Title: A Day that will Live in Infarmy
An ominous plume of smoke rose over the Moisture Farm representing an unprecedented event in Sandrock history: enemies successfully perpetrated a direct and deliberate attack against the city of Sandrock and its very livelihood. 

The Hydrogel, a rare machine that gathers water out of the air, was destroyed by the now infamous lizardman group known as the Geeglers, who have now displayed clear intent to drive out human civilization in the Eufaula; to what end, who can say?

The attack began with a diversion meant to grab the attention of the Civil Corps, while a smaller infiltration group broke into the Moisture Farm; they overwhelmed resident agriculturalist, Zeke, and began to immediately attack and set fire to crops and machines.

By some stroke of luck, Builder ''Player'' happened upon the scene and bravely lent a hand in repelling the repulsive Geeglers until the Civil Corps finally arrived to secure the area.

Though no one was harmed, it is projected that without the Hydrogel, it's only a matter of time before Sandrock runs out of food. City officials are looking into releasing the strategic grain storage to keep prices reasonable. Builders and researchers are working fast to try to replace the Hydrogel, but it's anyone's guess as to whether or not any of these things will pan out.

It has been recommended by the Church of the Light that all citizens of Sandrock not panic, decrease consumption of food and water, and to await further instructions as preparations are made for our next course of action.

Title: Who is the Geegler President?
A mysterious figure has been seen amongst the Geeglers in recent days, one that seems to command an aura of authority amongst the otherwise disorganized faction. This figure was seen directing the trash throwing committee that accosted an anonymous church member, polluting Martle's oasis, and has since been seen prowling around the Shonash Bridge, occasionally removing loose parts and running off with them.

It has come to light that the Geegler's recently radicalized behavior can all be traced to this one individual who calls himself: the Geegler President. According to intelligence reports from Civil Corps members, the Geegler President has used populist rhetoric to rise through the ranks and convince his fellow lizardmen that the known world belongs to them, and the only path forward for their people is the expulsion of any rival civilization.

"I figure they made him leader 'cause he's big," quipped Justice, sheriff and head of the Sandrock Civil Corps. "I guess I'm just sad he speaks our language but doesn't want to try to talk things out," added the deputy in training.

This Geegler President is probably the one behind the destruction of the Moisture Farm, and should be regarded as armed, possibly with garbage, and extremely dangerous. Any information that might lead to the capture of the Geegler President should be submitted immediately to sheriff Justice of the Sandrock Civil Corps.

Title: Creature Conspiracy Comes Out, President Perishes
A reconnaissance mission gone awry following the Civil Corps' ongoing investigation into the activity of the lizardman group known as the Geeglers has led to an extraordinary series of events resulting in the defeat of the Geegler leader and the destruction of Shonash Bridge. 

One day prior to the publication of this newspaper, sheriff Justice of the Sandrock Civil Corps and ''Player'', local workshop owner, were jettisoned directly into a Geegler stronghold and forced to fight their way to the surface after a recently repaired tram cable overseeing the Shonash Canyon suddenly snapped with the two inside the tram car. Miraculously, they have since returned to Sandrock unharmed.

It's common knowledge that the Geeglers had taken up refuge in the nearby, and perhaps aptly named, Gecko Station: an Old World construction that is speculated to have once been a travel hub. But unbeknownst to us, the Geeglers were not using Gecko Station as a mere proxy site for administering mischief, but in fact, they were planning something far more sinister.

Justice and ''Player'', facing insurmountable odds, not only fought their way out of enemy territory, but also uncovered the most elaborate Geegler plot yet: a nearly complete version of a superweapon, one fortified with powerful steel shielding and fit with destructive projectile weaponry. They intended to use their train weapon to destroy Sandrock!

Ironically, the literal fall of the Geegler President is owed most to none other than the Geeglers themselves, albeit with a bit of serendipitous coercion from our heroes. Believing his hand forced, the Geegler President set his train weapon on a course for Sandrock without consulting his advisors, then experienced firsthand the consequences of removing parts from the Shonash Bridge: the bridge collapsed under the tremendous weight of the armored train as it crossed, and the Geegler President plummeted along with it.

Since the event, the Geeglers have already moved out of many areas surrounding Sandrock, and it is expected that without leadership, this trend will continue. As for the bridge, Sandrock architects speculate that a new design will soon be available, and the personnel required to actualize it are ready and willing to act.

All in all, it has been a great day for Sandrock.

Title: Shonash Structural Settlement Slowed
Despite best efforts, one out of one architects agree: building a huge bridge is kinda hard!

While Sandrock is full of positive energy and can-do attitude, unfortunately that doesn't translate directly into construction ability. 

"Yeah, uh... I mean if you wanted that bridge smashed, you know, even more so...! That we could help with, but I mean, I dunno, I guess we could try to carry some stuff over for ya. Did you check the donation box? Me an' my boys put some stuff in there," Eufaula Salvage Foreman, Rocky, responded to quandaries from Construction Junction employees.

Indeed, the materials required for such a structure are not only great in number, but also great in size; moving objects over to the canyon, then up and down the canyon have proven to create major logistical setbacks for Sandrock's plucky and architectural association, Construction Junction. Nevertheless, they're far from throwing in the towel!

This reporter then made a two birds one stone type detour over to the Sandrock Research center to recruit, and also seek advice from the local researcher.

"Well, the simplest way to accomplish such a task would be to build some sort of bridge materializer: a device that could just create an entire bridge out of thin air at the push of a button. However, much of that technology doesn't exist anymore... or yet. Therefore, yes, perhaps some sort of machine to aid in construction would be a more inferential direction for research," mused the good doctor.

Construction Junction insiders assure the public that the bridge will be built, one way or another. They just ask for patience during this time, as hard as that may be.

Title: Infrastructure Inspection Imminent, Imbeciles Incredulous
Though this upcoming bridge inspection process is all very standard and nothing to be worried about, some of our less scientifically informed citizens still felt the need to weigh in anyway. Pen, while ceremoniously flexing his muscles suggested, "I said it before, and I'll say it again. Let me punch the bridge. If it breaks, it wasn't strong enough!" This reporter can confirm, however, there's no standardized bridge testing that involves any punching.

Furthermore, Elsie had this to add: "Seems a 'lil suspicious if you ask me, sendin' an engineer to inspect a bridge. Shouldn't they just stick to learnin' about engines? 'Sides, I jumped around on that new bridge already plenty! It's fine, I say! If I see this outsider engineerin' fella, you can best believe I'll be walkin' over to the other side of the road..."

Controversial opinions aside, it is this reporter's opinion that once we're able to receive our new guest, we ought to do so with our signature Sandrock hospitality!

Title: Bridge Built Back Better
One out of one Sandrock architects agree: the Shonash Bridge is back, and better than ever! 

Following the lizardfolk debacle, it turned out that the Ataran concerns for the integrity of our previous bridge were well founded. But all of that's Geeglers under the bridge now as the Atarans have already responded to our application via telegraph, promising to send one of their top engineers our way to do the inspection as soon as possible!

This engineer is set to arrive any day, so if you see an unfamiliar face in town, don't be afraid to give them a warm Sandrock welcome!

The bridge itself was a collaboration between the only architect of Sandrock and the Commerce Guild, with the process being expedited by Director Qi of the Research Center and his brilliant design for a construction-aiding mobile suit. "''Player'' and I are always excited to build up designs made by Heidi! And Director Qi's robot was super helpful, too!" said resident Builder and key contributor, Mi-an, on the matter.

As soon as the bridge is authorized for use by our Ataran inspector, trains from Atara will once again pull up in Sandrock station. And, really, who has any doubts about it not passing inspection, I mean, have you seen that diagram the Builders were working with?

In any case, it's rumored that once water shipments begin flowing back into Sandrock, capital secured by Town Hall as emergency funding is planned to be spent towards something beneficial for the city as a whole. Be sure to stay tuned to the Tumbleweed Standard for more news, and don't forget to renew your subscriptions if you haven't already!

Title: Remembering Mason
Foreward by Yan
Reported by Heidi

"Meh. He was alright, I guess." - Yan

Powerful words from the Commissioner of the Sandrock Commerce Guild that echo out as the absence of our town's former Builder is as palpable as ever.

"A role model? Um, to be honest, I hardly ever spoke to the guy," said new Builder Mi-an in an interview in which we reflected on the impact left by Mason's departure.

Yes, we all miss Mason. As a member of our community, he wasn't the most out-spoken, kind, or even borderline personable. As a Builder, he wasn't the most hard-working, able, or talented. But as a man: Mason was... eh... he was...

Dang, I can't think of a way to end that sentence. Let's just hope no one reads this.

Title: The History of the Rutabaga
By Elsie, as dictated by Cooper
Editor: Heidi
Now the history of the rutabaga is a curious one; its trials and tribulations, an inspiration to us all. In this essay, I intend to unravel the intricate tapestry of events that have led to our modern understanding of the vegetable, and also to outline the echoes of its inception which reverberate throughout history.
With humble beginnings, the rutabaga was formed out of necessity; a hybrid of the turnip and the cabbage, crossbred to create a compromise between turnip lovers, who found parsnips to be far too bitter, and aficionados of the parsnip, who, generally speaking, did not care for the consistency of the turnip. They found it to be too firm.
Blah blah blah, I'm an old geezer who talks too much. I never let my daughter do nothing she wants to, I just make her sit here and take trifiling notes about stupid vegetables that don't even taste good. No one's going to read my meandering essay for nobody and even if somebody did, I'd never know about it cause I can't even read. That boy Mint is so dreamy. I wonder if he knows how to ride a yakmel? I hope he wouldn't not fancy me because I don't know a thing about engineering... Anyway, blah blah blah, I'm old, the end.

Title: Death of a Water Tower
Had it been anywhere else, I would have said the rain had fallen in a torrential downpour, but Sandrock has taught me to treasure every drop, for here, water is more precious than power stones. 

A blast. In a moment, my whole world shook. It is hard to put into words the abject terror that accompanies that cacophony of sound. What was happening? All I could see was dust and dinas. 

Was I safe? I felt trapped in the middle of a warzone, the eye of the storm. The calm and the frenzied arrived in equal measure. People screaming, begging for their lives; a lone tumbleweed softly bouncing. A child, lost and alone, cried for her mother; debris floating peacefully in my Sand Tea.

I saw the silhouette first, then the galloping hooves. A train passed and the whinny rang out like a shill battlecry. Logan: the fearesome bandit had struck again.

Title: Lost in the Little Woods
Sandrock recently celebrated the opening of their Little Woods, a project which is part of the ongoing redevelopment of Sandrock.

Sandrock is a town that has a storied history. A town which once was a thriving center for archaeology and development, a treasure trove for lost relics. The epynomynous "Relic Rush" was a time of riches, where everyone saw Gols in their eyes, their gaze fixed on this small oasis of untouched Old World jewels.

That rush was fleeting, however. Soon, the resources had dried, and the town braced for a new, rapidly degrading environment. Sandstorms, droughts, pirates, and bandits. These terrors brought Sandrock to its knees. The exodus left the town as a shadow of its former self.

But this has been changing. A new future is on the horizon. Sandrock has been working tirelessly to fight back against the conditions that plague the town. Even in the short time I have been here, Sandrock has made strides to be a safe and hospitable place for future generations. The ultimate goal: to make Sandrock green. This may seem like a sysiphean task, but I have witnessed first hand what human dedication and wits can do. 

The Little Woods project seems to herald the start of this new age, and although a modest effort for now, the allocation is a huge swathe of desert. This seems to be a humble start, but with lofty ideals. 

This reporter had the welcome chance to ask a few questions of Trudy, the mayor leading this replantation effort. After a round of pleasantries and thank-yous, the motivation for staying in Sandrock was made abundantly clear. 

"It's been a part of our lives since our childhood" said the Mayor. "We do this for ... all the people we've lost here." And finally, with fervor hard to replicate in text, "if we let Sandrock disappear, we let their memories fade with it and allow their sacrifice to be meaningless." 
These powerful words exemplify the attachment and determination the citizens have for this town. They are not doing this for themselves, but for the people who have given their lives to turn this small patch of desert into a little place called home.

Title: ATTENTION: Man who looks like Yan is NOT YAN!
Everyone please be aware that the newest member of our town, Wei, is in fact related in no way, shape, or form to our former crooked commissioner, Yan. Okay, poorly phrased, they are related, they're actually twin brothers... but Wei is nothing like Yan! He's a good and honest commissioner and he's here to turn things around for the Commerce Guild of Sandrock.

Don't believe me? Do a little test! Dangle a Gol on a string in front of his face and watch how he doesn't immediately enter a feral attack mode in attempt to wrench it from you, and in fact, acts like a normal person and responds with such queries as, "Why are you doing this?"

Wei has a lot of experience as a commissioner, and he used to do excursions into the Peripheries; buy him a Yakmel Milk and ask him about his stories sometime!

Title: Brave Bandit Behind Bars
Logan's trial and sentencing has put a somber close to this chapter of Sandrock's history.

Our enemies defeated, now is the time to keep records, decompress, and also to keep score. Logan was a hero during the Battle of Sandrock, no one contests that. But unfortunately, Logan didn't do everything by the book. There were times he had to bend the law, and he himself admits there should be consequences.

Sandrock is a land of law, and no one is above that law.

We all look forward to the end of Logan's sentencing so that he may rejoin society and make Sandrock whole again.

Title: The Veritable Tunnel and the Human Condition
A tunnel to a brighter future. What does a tunnel represent? A liminal space, transitional, inspiring. Everyone's life has a tunnel. Your first steps. Your first love. Your first sip of hot Sand Tea. For Sandrock, the first drops of rain will be the next tunnel they seek. But this is the tunnel we have now. It's real, tangible. It leads off to distant lands, with the promise of a new salvation. 

A tunnel - a light at the end. A sea of sand and silt separating us... from them. Them - the future. The connection. A hand held close to your heart. A hand clutching an olive branch. A hope for peace - for the future. 

But what is a tunnel? It is a hole through an object that leads from one place to the next. That is, of course, our physical, tangible tunnel. But what is a tunnel? Something that brings us to our next destination? In life, we travel through various destinations. I started my life in Atara, writing news articles and novels. But I travelled a tunnel, both literal and metaphorical, to arrive in Sandrock. Sandrock was my new life, a world of new experiences. A way to find my feet, and understand the true world.

It started with a tunnel. It ended with a tunnel. It continues, through a tunnel. A tunnel of dreams, of hopes and desires, for a better future. For everyone.

Title: A Calmer, Calmer, Calmer Chameleon
Heads up to everyone out there who sees that vaguely familiar looking lizard fellow walking around Sandrock!

Yes, he is our former arch-nemesis who sought to conquer Sandrock (which he had previously assumed to be the entire world, based on what little knowledge he had), but... No! He is not dangerous!

We'll be putting him through a series of rigorous tests, some of the same ones that proved how insane Yan was, to, well, hopefully prove that this Geegler is in fact not insane!

It's the Sandrock way, and standard Church of the Light teachings to never turn someone away who wants to be better.

So we better put our money where our mouths are and pony up a bit of tolerence for our recently reformed friend to be!

Title: Sandrock Seeks Sound Suggestions for Success
Come one, come all! The new age of Sandrock is upon us, and it could be YOUR next big idea that becomes the next major City Hall project!

We've got the budget, we've got management, and plans? Oh, you betcha! The skies are blue and the birds are singing, singing a song of opportunity! Sandrock is on the map! And not just one of those small dots where you have to squint to read the text, I think we're getting a star the likes of Atara and Highwind!

"The word has spread that we Sandrockers can handle anything the world thows at us. And I'm no expert, but that's the kind of spirit I'd want to invest in!" Mayor Trudy had this to say on the matter.

With Portian water pouring in and planting plans on the horizon, everything's coming up for Sandrock! Speak with Mayor Trudy to organize a time to present your pitch for Sandrock's next big project!

Title: Top Builders of Portia
Lately, development in Portia has been better and more efficient than ever. Portia Town Hall would like to acknowledge the following Builders:

King of Kings - An alias of a Builder that worked hard to make things better for the world, but still did more by defending it with martial strength. A soft and empathetic Builder known for rising to the occasion, pushed by the challenges of our dangerous world to protect those close to him. 

Pilar - An extremely diligent Builder who strives to always add to her list of achievements; her workshop is known around the land for quality, punctuality, and heart.

Darko - One of the greatest Builders to ever walk among the Free Cities; it's been said that the size of the commission board in Portia was expanded to keep up with the demand that Darko created.

Shahyel - Famous not only for top notch production, but also for having a really cool workshop logo. Some wonder if the logo was what led Shahyel to greatness, but most consider it to be a chicken/egg kind of situation.

Giru - Everybody knows and loves Giru. It's not just Giru's hard work and skill that endears us; spending even just a moment in Giru's company will leave you with a feeling of attachment.

Shagar - Friendly, dependable, and exactly the guy you want checking up on your machines. Has improved the efficiency of twelve other workshops and counting with his incisive insight and consultation.

Honorable Mention:

Higgins - He tries real hard, don't you know?

Title: Small Setback Slows Spread of Shrubbery
A lot of people are wondering what's going on over in the Eufaula Outback, so we at the Tumbleweed Standard are here to inform and clear up all the rumors!

While it is disappointing that we've hit some minor setbacks in our forestation efforts, we want to remind everyone that these kinds of issues are completely normal in this field of research! Sometimes things just don't work, and we don't know why. But all that will change, so everyone please stay patient.

Efforts are already being made here within Sandrock, and we're also reaching out to various offices in the Free Cities, looking for support and advice from other planting experts around the world.

The whole Alliance is invested in seeing Sandrock blossom now, so don't lose hope!

Title: School's in, Forever!
Sound the bell, school's in session!

Actually, I'm not sure we have a bell. But you get the idea! Sandrock now retakes its position as a major city-state in the Alliance by meeting all municipality standards as established by the Alliance Council. Go us!

This school has just been one of the many recent developments representing our meteoric rise, and this plucky reporter likes to believe that the best is yet to come!

We had a quick word with new teacher Jane on what to expect from her new curriculum.

"I'm here to build an environment where the children of Sandrock can grow. I believe in not just the power of reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also, the joy of art, and song, and participation..." she said.

Looks like we can expect our kids to be brimming with knowledge and culture in no time! I for one will be sitting front row at one of Miss Jane's upcoming school plays.

Title: Savvy Scientists Seek to Solve Sandrock's Setback
Hardly a few days since our recent run-in with a wall over at the Eufaula Outback, and already we're hard at work on a solution! 

City Hall has managed to get in touch with a leading expert on the subject of soil and planting from Highwind, Professor Luo! The esteemed academic has already taken an interest in, local planter, Zeke's work.

One of Professor Luo's hallmark achievements include the work he did on fertilizer for his doctorate degree. By identifying a key nitrate molecule, he was able to design new types of fertilizer that can be used in varying climates and locations.

"Professor Luo is the best we've got! When he and Zeke get together, I'm sure we'll reach a solution!" his assistant Nia said in response.

Clearly these two are extremely qualified to help our resident soil expert, Zeke, find a breakthrough to get us through that planting problem that has plagued us so pertinently!

Title: Oasis Overflowing via Opposite of Ordinary Operations
It's always the last place you look!

Resident science afficionado and superstar at the Research Center, Director Qi has made a rather astounding discovery!

Not of his usual caliber, ones that are a bit too dense to explain to the general public, but a classical style discovery; you know, where you go to a place that no one has ever been to before and you're like, "Woah, look at this! This is a discovery!"

Indeed! Qi's hobby bordering on obsession with spacecrafts has led him to dig through all sorts of nooks and crannies over at the Starship Ruins, and ultimately uncovered a device used to, more-or-less, create water out of thin air!

Of course, that was only the first step. ''Player'' and Justice went in to secure the relic, and from there, City Hall in cooperation with (shout out) Construction Junction, made a plan to create a pipeline from this machine to Sandrock.

But don't take my word for it, simply look out your window! The oasis is fuller than it has ever been in most of our lifetimes! It seems safe to say, that at least for the foreseeable future, the Sandrock water shortage is over.

Title: Dungeon Drama Delved up, Another Ancient Algae Acquired
Breakthroughs are on the horizon as stalwart citizens Logan, Nia, and ''Player'' braved the depths of yet another treacherous dungeon to discover another strain of the mysterious Old World algae that has been fueling our Biocrust research.

Along the way they met the usual trials and tribulations that many Hazardous Ruins harbor within, but also, they discovered an unusual turn of events... it seems our old enemies, the Geeglers, had taken up refuge in these ruins, and... well, this time they weren't really plotting anything... we kind of just barged in on them... 

But their new leader Gary was being really inappropriate with our new friend Larry's wife! So I think that pretty well justifies whatever... may or may not have gone down in the depths of the under sea lab ruins.

Resident relationship advice expert had this to say on the matter:

"I say keep putting fuel on the fire! I've asked one of my Geegler associates from the Outback to stop in and try to stumble into a chance meeting with Xena just to see where it goes. I'm tired of love triangles, I want to see a love pentagon! Dodecahedron!" -Pablo

Hey everyone! It's me, Jasmine, taking over for Aunt Heidi this week. Aunt Heidi has been really busy lately, plus, I've already been on all the rides, so we both agreed now would be a good time to write my first front page article for Catori World! Woo! Excited.

Okay, soooo.... Catori World is great! It has rides, it has lights, it has animals, and performers, and Catori said there's going to be a lot more to come ("If sales meet expectations")!

"Well, sweet pea, I made a place like this because I want kids like you to have a place where you can just be... kids! Have fun, and... share with your families some of the best experiences in life you can have, together."

Very moving words from Aunt Catori. But one thing she forgot to say when I asked why she made Catori World is... the moneeeeey!

Everybody knows Aunt Catori likes money. But Aunt Catori is not wrong! Money is a good thing. Money can be used to buy:

-Cats
-Cat Food
-Dogs
-Dog Food
-Books
-And many more

In summary, Catori World is very fun, and will our town grow, and that is good.

Title: Sandrock Wins the Battle, and the War
Recently, after experiencing years upon years of bitter battles against the sandstorms, Sandrock has finally won! Sandstorms now are disappearing into thin air before they can blow into Sandrock proper! This is neither a rumor nor magic but the result of the collective efforts of Sandrock citizens in planting a forest barrier in the Eufaula Outback. Our reporter was present at the scene and was blessed to be able to witness this remarkable sight firsthand.

This signifies that the people of Sandrock have rescued the town from sandstorms, and we can foresee that in the near future, Sandrock will regain its former glory. This reporter also interviewed the townspeople regarding this matter. Currently, everyone in Sandrock is immersed in joy and has spontaneously taken action to push towards the final steps in creating a green haven in the desert!

Local planting expert, Mr. Zeke, stated that this is only the beginning of the new Sandrock. The greenification and sand prevention efforts will not lose momentum; now receiving assistance from Professor Luo, a planting expert from Highwind, it's almost certain that in the future, Sandrockers will witness more miracles.

We have reason to believe that Sandrock will eventually reclaim its title as the "Jewel of the Eufaula," and that day shouldn't be too far off.

It's official, the next host site for the Quinquennial Free Cities Alliance Summit will be none other than... Sandrock!

I probably wouldn't have primed that sentence with so much excitement if it were any other city than Sandrock. How awful would that be: "Drumroll please! It's in Atara. Again. No news. Go back to bed."

Anyway! The summit is coming to Sandrock! In addition to the fantastic acknowledgement from the rest of the Alliance that Sandrock is a hospitable enough place to host the summit, it's going to be a really great time, and it's all coming right to us!

During the first day, representatives from all the major city-states will come and discuss Alliance politics behind closed doors in City Hall. Meanwhile, we'll have talks from locals and esteemed guests on some of the important things we've learned in the past five years.

Some notable speakers will include, but not be limited to:

- Esteemed business mogul, Musa
- The gardener who never said die, Zeke
- Ged the Mole

So clear out your schedules, invite all your friends, the Quinquennial Free Cities Alliance Summit is going to be the party everyone will be talking about until... well, at least til the next summit!

Well, everybody, just because there are no crazy big adventures going on right now doesn't mean it's the end of the world! Now we can relax, maybe even get to know each other better! Maybe you can make friends with someone you never thought possible!

And... well... this is Sandrock... so... You pretty much know something crazy is going to happen pretty soon. So... just enjoy the peace and quiet!
