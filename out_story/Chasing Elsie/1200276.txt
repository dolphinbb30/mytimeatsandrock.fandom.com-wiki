(cId 0) A conversation 2726_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Elsie|''Player''! You came! You got here alright? No one followed you? My Ma... how is she?}}

*''She's worried about you.''
*''Come on, go home already!''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=She's worried about you.
|I know... I'm worried about her too. She still ain't healed up yet...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Come on, go home already!
|No! I ain't goin' home...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|But... did ya see my Pa back then? Man, I don't remember the last time he got that angry...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|There ain't no pleasin' him. No matter what I do, he's always gonna see me as some little girl doin' stupid stuff.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|After Ma got hurt, Pa's been on my case nonstop. I get it, my Ma gettin' hurt was my fault, and I'm so sorry it happened. But the Martle Ducks are suppose to be gentle creatures, that's why I tried to attract one.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|My old man would know if he'd only read a book 'bout it... but he threw it away... and he doesn't read anyway. Pfft.}}

*''Why did he do that?''
*''Was that book really important?''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Why did he do that?
|He said it was cuz I learned 'bout that soup lure from the book... Said Trudy shouldn't be lendin' it out that easy. But... it's Howlett's book, it's like a piece of history! How could he disrespect him like that?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Was that book really important?
|Duh! It's Howlett's! Guy's a monster huntin' legend! How can Pa disrespect him like that?! Jus' throwin' it away! It's a piece of history!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Y'know, I actually rented out both of Howlett's books. One was the one Pa threw away... full of all these pretty pictures, and lure recipes an' the like. The other one's called "What It Takes to be a Real Monster Hunter." Pa didn't find that one...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I brought it with me, and read it cover to cover. The more I read it, the more sense it made. Most monsters out there don't wanna hurt us, they just want to be left alone. And the best way to go about it ain't to shoot'em up.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|It's more about how to co-exist. Howlett wrote that force should always be the last resort. There's always others ways to get the creatures to behave differently! It's fascinating stuff!}}

*''So you're just going to stay here forever?''
*''Then what do you plan to do?''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=So you're just going to stay here forever?
|Nah, this is jus' my secret place. I need to unwind a bit...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I ain't the kinda person to run away from my problems. Right now, I'm jus' focusin' on that giant duck. It hurt Ma... but I dunno why... an' I reckon it can hurt more folks. I've gotta right this wrong.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I'm gonna find it, and I'm gonna do it my way. I ain't gonna go in wildly wavin' a shotgun like my Pa... I jus' gotta learn about it, its habits, what it likes.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Howlett did it, Martle did it, I'm gonna walk in their footsteps! I ain't figured out what I gotta do, though. If only Pa hasn't thrown the book away...}}

*''I'll get your book back for you.''
*''I'll make you a weapon.''
*''Good luck.''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=I'll get your book back for you.
|My old man chucked it into the canyon... it ain't gonna be found, I tell ya. Urgh, jus' thinkin' about all the work Howlett put into that book...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=I'll make you a weapon.
|I appreciate it, but I ain't lookin' to start shootin'... I don't wanna hurt it like that Meerkat.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|I reckon I gotta figure out my own way to do this.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Good luck.
|Hehe, if ya see a shootin' star, spare me a wish, will ya?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|reward={{i2|Little Lamb Doll|1}}|Oh yeah, I do have a favor to ask ya.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I got somethin'... I want you to give it to my Ma. It's a doll from when I was a kid... I kept it in my Treasure Chest. Please take it to her, she'll know I'm okay.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Also... wouldya mind pickin' some herbs for my Ma? I wanna make sure she's gettin' better. I got a little money saved up, you can take it.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Phew, I'm feelin' a lot better after talkin' to you. Alright, you can head back now, I gotta go find that duck!}}
