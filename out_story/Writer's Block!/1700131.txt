{{dialogue|Ernest|I am absolutely amazed at your craftmanship! This set is good enough to put my Pa's furniture to shame! I don't know what to say!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|I guess now that the furniture has been taken care of, we can get the housewarming party started!}}

*''What do you mean?''
*''Shouldn't you be writing?''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=What do you mean?
|Being new to Sandrock, it might be in my best interest to make some new friends, and of course, treat my existing friends to a good night of fun!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Shouldn't you be writing?
|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=-1}}|That's the idea, and that's why I invited you over! I already have a mental draft of the novel, but I just need to liven up my new place a bit to get my hands all prepped for writing!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|How about it? You want to come?}}

*''Party time!''
*''I might be busy...''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=I might be busy...
|Out of all the Builders I've talked with, you definitely take the cake for being the hardest working. Oh well, we can talk about the party next time then. I'm not too keen on parties anyway.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Good! Good! Let me tell you what you need to bring.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Let's see, can you bring {{textcolor|green|one dish}}? If one person brings one dish, ten people should bring enough for a feast! I'll take care of the other stuff.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|One more thing. Is there anyone else I should invite, in your opinion?}}

*''Everyone in Sandrock!''
*''Minister of the Church.''
*{{flirt}}''Just me is enough.''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Everyone in Sandrock!
|But it's just a housewarming party. Getting the whole town might be overdoing it. By my next birthday I should be more acquainted with everyone. I'll invite everyone to that party instead, and I'll even get my cook to fix up some nice dishes.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Minister of the Church.
|Though it might seem like proper etiquette, I really can't see myself doing something only my Pa would do...To be honest, I'm quite fed up already with pretentious parties with high society.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Just me is enough.
|As a gentleman, I should appreciate your initiative, but that's a bit too fast for me!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|Haha, I'm just kidding. But since you already put it that way, you'd better come!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Anyway, I'll write up the other invitations right now. No point in keeping you here. See you at {{textcolor|green|18:00PM tomorrow}}. Remember, bring {{textcolor|green|one dish}}!}}
The conversation ends.
