(cId -1) A conversation 883_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Ernest|Good day, Builder! I'll have you know that I've decided to stay in this town until I finish writing the story on Logan. It's the hot story in the press right now and my editor Eduardo's adamant that "I see it to the end, no matter the cost."}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Since I don't see Logan being captured any time soon, I've decided to move into the Oldtown Lodge. The Blue Moon is cheap and quaint, but it's so noisy that I can't write for the life of me, and I keep having nightmares.}}

*''What are you writing?''
*''Nightmares?''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=What are you writing?
|Writing for the Atara Times is only my day job, I'm actually a novelist at heart. Though I'm a bit upset that my Pa sent his strictest editor to oversee my writing, I wholeheartedly believe that my writing will one day see mass popularity.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Nightmares?
|Yes. Nightmares about the editor my Pa appointed to oversee my work. That man is a monster who would butcher my work until he saw fit.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Indeed, small columns pay the bills, but are hardly fulfilling as a creator. The novel is the true proving ground for one's skill! This "Logan" character; adapting his story into a narrative of my own... could be the next big step for my career.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Hm? Oh, well, yes, of course I have to do an adaptation, not just write about his life. I'm writing a novel, not a biography. Plus, if I used his likeness without his permission, who knows what a crude felon like that could do... He might sue!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Furthermore, I'll never meet the guy- Well, let's hope. I'll never get an interview, I'll certainly never get permission to write about him, and... yeah. This way I can write whatever I think will be best for the novel! Much better.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|I'll just make a bandit character based on him and call him... Rocky! ... No, no... Uh... Dr. Killface- Agh! That's terrible...! ...Ah! Right, of course... I did actually have a point to make with this tangent: that desk at my new apartment!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|That desk; the height is all wrong! The way I have to sit to write, it cuts off all the circulation to my brain; now all my ideas are terrible! So! I need your finest Writing Desk with a pulpous Comfy Chair to get the juices flowing again. I'm counting on you!}}

*''No problem!''
*''I really can't...''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=No problem!
|Great! Remember, I need the finest {{textcolor|green|Writing Desk}} with a pulpous {{textcolor|green|Comfy Chair}}.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|I'll hold off on the writing until I get the furniture set. The best stories need the best furniture!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|I got another Builder and the local carpenter to help out with the rest of the furnishings. Can't wait for everything to be ready!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=I really can't...
|I suppose I can wait around a tad longer if you're busy. Just remember to help me out when you're done.}}
