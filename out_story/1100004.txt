{{dialogue|Mort|The methods in the book seemed out of our grasp however, until... I noticed that the messages I used to write in the sand with straw... if I made them into a square, they could protect plants inside it from the blowing sands. And so began the {{textcolor|green|"straw grid."}}}}
{{dialogue|Mort|I began digging thousands of squares across the desert, sowing stubborn plants in each of them, ones I knew could survive. As the plants grew, the straw became like fertilizer. After a few cycles, sand turned back into soil again.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|We couldn't be much older than twenty in this photo? This is not long after we met at the oasis.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|She was running her hotel, and I was a gardner with no real purpose... We met when I was just passing through, and I was instantly struck by her passion; she told me about her dream to share Sandrock's beauty with the world...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|How strange that those fiery eyes, full of passion would soon instead be full of tears, and all because her dream came true. Indeed, she shared her oasis with the world, but the world did not return the same kindness.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Nothing gold can stay; time, regrettably, marches on in only one direction. Perhaps Sandrock was destined to be used up. I tried my best to turn back time in the desert, I was but one man... and my quest... was folly... hm...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|...She looks so happy in this photo, I'd almost forgotten about that look of hers. If only I'd stopped her that day... when she went to check on the straw grid... Oh... sorry, I've kept you too long, haven't I?}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Young one, thank you for bringing this to me. It feels good to share these old stories with someone who will hear them... Please stop by if you find any more of my photos.}}
