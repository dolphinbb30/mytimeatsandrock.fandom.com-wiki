{{dialogue|Gaudi|Smile, Avery. I know you'd rather be back at headquarters, but everyone's here to welcome us.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|If only General Ling hadn't insisted that I join the summit...}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|Hey, you've been to Sandrock before. I'm sure you're missed here.}}
The conversation ends.
{{dialogue|Player|...}}

*''It's true! Where have you been, Avery?''
*''I'm not so sure about that...''

{{dialogue|Avery|Ah, glad to see you again, Builder. This is my colleague, Mr. Gaudi.}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|You must be the Builder everyone's been talking about! The pleasure is all mine. I can't wait to see what you've accomplished in Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Avery|Mr. Gaudi is our chief engineering consultant, a very capable Builder himself. He's working with us on the planning of the North Development Plan at the borders. We're lucky to have his help. I'm sure you'll have a lot to discuss.}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|Yes, and here's Avery, trying to shrug me off and secretly plotting his revenge against Duvos.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|...I only have the safety of the Alliance in mind.}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|I often have to remind this guy that the whole point of the development plan is to keep the peace for as long and as wide as possible. That's why we're focused on bringing in talented people and resources to those areas.}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|While everything is in the early stages, it presents a fantastic opportunity for someone like you to become a settlement Governor if you join the plan. They oversee the design and development of an entire town, going beyond the limits of a Workshop yard.}}

*''Sounds fun!''
*''Sounds challenging...''

{{dialogue|Gaudi|indent=true|answer=Sounds fun!
|Absolutely! It's hard work but in an exciting way. I'm looking forward to sharing our progress with other representatives at the summit and getting their input on our next steps.}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|indent=true|answer=Sounds challenging...
|Indeed! It's challenging but also thrilling. I'm looking forward to sharing our progress with other representatives at the summit and getting their input on our next steps.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|Or we could discuss with the reps the possibility of forming a fast-response plan in case Duvos ever plots another move...}}
{{dialogue|Avery|In any case, it was good seeing you again, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Gaudi|And an honor to meet you as well! I'm sure we'll see plenty more of each other tomorrow at the banquet!}}
{{dialogue|Avery|Til then.}}
The conversation ends.
