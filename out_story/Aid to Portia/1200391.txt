Title: Crisis in Portia Averted!
Welcome to your source on the All Source, the Portia Times!
Yes, everyone is wondering what happened with the recent attempt by the Sky Sharks and someone calling themselves the "Rogue Knight" to steal our newly discovered mega-relic: the All Source! Although she goes by Wendy these days...
Well, firstly, we're all fine, thanks for asking! A few buildings exploded, a lot of wild sword duels took place, and... I think somehow an entire schoolhouse was used as a projectile weapon... but, other than that: fine!
Oh, and also, don't worry about the whole geopolitical nature of it all. Yes, the Rogue Knight has ties to the Duvos Empire, but it is believed that he was operating alone, hence the name... "rogue..." Furthermore, the Duvos Empire has been extremely cooperative following the Sandrock incident, so tensions seem to be settling quickly.
So... if you were worried about us or the world going to war; you can stop reading here! But if you'd like to know more about what happened, read on!
Quick history lesson: an All Source computer is a rare AI from the Old World; it's hard to say how many other than ours still exist! All Source computers acted as a managing unit; one that would broadcast orders to all other AI in its network, and most of the times, these networks were the size of a whole country! 
It's believed that a lack of connection to their All Sources is what has caused the rampant AI issues that we have throughout the Free Cities these days. Some hypothesize that gaining an understanding of the All Source may one day make it possible for us to heal the confused AI out there and make the world a safer place for everyone.
That, however, would not be everyone's hopes for the All Source... the Rogue Knight believed it could be used as a weapon, which he demonstrated by... using it as a weapon. Fortunately, the All Source can only use offensive functions when connected to other AI that have those functions, and for now, those devices have been destroyed.
Portian researchers, Merlin and Petra, will continue monitoring the All Source and report any findings to the public.

{{dialogue|Trudy|Yes, thankfully, no one was seriously injured. They're just going to need to do a lot of building to get their town back in shape...}}
