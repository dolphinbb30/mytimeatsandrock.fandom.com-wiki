{{dialogue|Vivi|It's the job! I swear I hear the doors of that Commerce Guild next door opening and shutting at all hours of the day and night.}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Well, whenever we put up a commission, most times it's done within the day. We didn't used to have this kinda twenty four hour turnaround... Is it possible... that the Builders are bein' worked like mules so that folks like us can enjoy the most minor of conveniences...!?}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|I say it's ambition. Some of these Builders work themselves half to death just to make an extra buck. Sad to say they'll be paying it all back down the line with doctor bills to restore the body they destroyed in the process...}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Half... to death...?}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Doctor Fang! We were just talking about you! Kinda. Talking about staying healthy and what not.}}
