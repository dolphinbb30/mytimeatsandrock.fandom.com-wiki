{{dialogue|Qi|It moved!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes! I felt it!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|This feeling... deep inside me. Every time we touch...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Perhaps I should explain. When we danced the other day... I felt something, deep inside me. A type of... shock? Sudden and strong.}}
The conversation ends.
{{dialogue|Qi|Hence, I built this thermo-electronitron. It can measure a body's electronic impulse fluctuations. I have been checking for any irregularities over the last few days.}}

*''It's probably just static electricity.''
*{{flirt}}''Are you sure it's not... love?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=It's probably just static electricity.
|I suppose that's a possibility... Static electricity is easily built up in dry environments such as this... However, it is puzzling. Why do I only feel the charges when I am with you?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Are you sure it's not... love?
|My love of Science has not increased lately, and I have not had any complications before. I would expect that I would have increased impulses in the Research Center were that the case...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I need to do more tests. I will report back with conclusive results tomorrow.}}

*''Uh huh... bye, then.''
*{{flirt}}''I'll come and help you.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I'll come and help you.
|Hm... you wish to come with me? Perhaps that would be helpful. It would provide sufficient natural conditions for study. First we go to the Clinic. We need to check for bodily abnormalities.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|That's fantastic! Seems that my calculations are correct after all! Let me tell you how I was able to prove that statement.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|What I did first was to turn my thermo-electronitron to 100 volts and test all possible nodes at the Center. Then I changed it to 1000 volts and tried again... Anyways, the result was that there was no leakage at the Research Center.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|The second hypothesis was that the "shock" was caused by a condition in my heart. However, I should have been getting stronger lately due to my training for the Mobile Suit.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|My heart rate did not deviate from my regular 120 beats per minute, average for someone with a caffeine consumption as high as mine. Besides, the doctor's diagnosis also said I was healthy. Thus the second hypothesis was false.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|The third hypothesis was that the shock came from static electricity due to physical contact. My investigation of static shock at Vivi's showed me that the shock I experienced was completely different.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Which means the truth should be my fourth hypothesis. That is, it's a reaction caused by my proximity with the one I like. Another piece of information I received was the statement from you, that you like me too!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Yes. Another one would be that I become unable to work when my mind is filled with you. I had to force any thoughts of you out of my mind before I can concentrate. Yet somehow, my work efficiency greatly increases when you're near. That's odd.}}

*''I think I understand.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Still not enough.
