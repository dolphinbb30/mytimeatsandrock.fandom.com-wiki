{{dialogue|Nia|Haha! I saw the look on your face at the meeting! You didnt expect to see me here did you?}}

*''Why didn't you tell me you were coming?''
*''How long are you staying?''
*''I didn't expect you'd hide it from me!''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
|Haha, I wanted to surprise you!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Well someone got married without telling me! So consider us even.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=How long are you staying?
|Hmmm let me think...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|One... two... one hundred...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|However long you want!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Haha, I'm kidding. We'll have to see how much work I need to do. So it rests on your shoulders, Super Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=I didn't expect you'd hide it from me!
|I wanted it to be a surprise!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|I kept wanting to tell you, but I managed to keep it a secret. Now I'll have your surprised face burned into my memory.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Feels like the little games we'd play as kids again haha!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Anyway, the real reason I'm here is so I can help with the soil problem. I told you I'd come back. So I didn't really lie did I?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Now that you're super famous and everything, my parents weren't as worried about me to coming over here.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|They told me that I had a lot to learn from you, haha!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Oh yeah, your Ma and Pa told me to make sure you take breaks, to remind you to take a vacation once in a while.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|But I don't think they need to worry. You're married now! You have someone to take care of you, right?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|C'mon then, fill me in! How are things going with you? I need to write back and let them know!}}

*''Everything's great! Sandrock's getting better all the time!''
*''Tired, but worth it.''
*''I'm safe, don't worry!''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Everything's great! Sandrock's getting better all the time!
|Yeah! I didn't expect Sandrock to start working on a whole forest this quickly! I'm glad though, it gave me an excuse to visit!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|You guys really are amazing! After so many challenges one after another... you still kept your spirit high!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|I respect the heck outta this town. You've got to tell me all the stories later.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Tired, but worth it.
|You know, before we came, Professor Luo told me that even though Sandrock has solved most of the planting issues, there're still many unknown factors that can derail the plan to be green again.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|I know it's not going to be easy, but coming here and working on this project will not only be great for my education, but also a memorable life experience!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Most people will go through life never encountering an event so meaningful...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|But not you, right? You've been changing history since the first day you arrived here, haha!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=I'm safe, don't worry!
|Don't blame your parents for worrying! It's not everyday a part of the Alliance gets invaded by Duvos! We were all so frightened! I would have came right away if not for the Highwind government blocking all travel here for a duration.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Sandrock is so far from the border, who knew Duvos would have the audacity to attack here? Your Ma's really unflappable, she told me everything's gonna be fine, to just put our trust in you.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|And she was right! You came through! Still... promise to never do this to me again... When the news first reached me, I couldn't even breathe!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Now that I see you in front of me with my own eyes, I can finally be sure you're okay.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Still, seeing my best friend working so hard to build this city... I just want to help out in some way!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Well, I'm gonna go and get settled. I'll see you later, alright?}}
