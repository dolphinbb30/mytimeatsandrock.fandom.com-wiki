Title: Architecture Competition Comes to a Close
In a minor upset, the winner of the Vincent Design Institute's architecture competition was the fourth place contestant, Dot!

Her design for a theater, which has been described by fellow Highwind citizens as "unusual," really grabbed the attention of the judges, including head designer, Master Verna.

"It's vogue, it's hip, it's in, defying all norms, it's the future! Not like some of our more... rebellious submissions. I know I said I liked 'defying norms' but some of our submissions were not rebellious in the way I wanted," said Verna on her decision. 

Runner-up, Gust of Portia had this to say on the results over the telegraph, "Honestly it's a tragedy. Just a popularity contest. If anyone had a chance to beat me, it would've been Heidi from Sandrock and she's what? Last place? Hmph. That's all I'm going to write."

Though not making much of a splash in Atara, local Sandrockers agree that Heidi's latest design is excellent as usual. Different strokes for different folks!

{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey! ''Player''! Got somethin'... I wanna say to you!}}

*''What's up?''
*''Is it about the competition?''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=What's up?
|Yeah, somethin' I've kinda been thinking about for a while...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Is it about the competition?
|Huh? That old thing? Nah, I've already forgotten about that.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Well, I was just thinkin'... After what we talked about and all... I was just thinkin'... we should be... "more than friends!"}}

*''More than friends...?''
*''Er, did you win the competition or something?''
*{{flirt}}''I was going to tell you the same thing...''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=More than friends...?
|Yeah. I like you, ''Player''! A lot. And lately... it's just been more clear than ever. Er, maybe I should explain myself a bit... Remember that whole Verna competition thing?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Er, did you win the competition or something?
|Oh, uh... yeah... about that...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=I was going to tell you the same thing...
|Ha! Well, looks like I beat you to it... And seein' as I'm the one doin' the confessin'... Hm. Maybe I just better start at the top. So, right. First: about that competition thing...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I lost! I mean, we both knew that's what we were signing up for, right? Didn't affect me in the slightest. I came up with an idea that I like, and ended up with something far better than any prize...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I always had my suspicions, but having you there made me really get it... You make me feel... safe! And fine. And special! And... like I can do anything I set my mind to...!}}

*''Yeah, that competition never mattered.''
*''You sure losing didn't cause you to say this...?''
*''I was just happy to be there for you...''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Yeah, that competition never mattered.
|Uh... huh... someone's... changing the topic, hm?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=You sure losing didn't cause you to say this...?
|Er... if you don't feel the same way... that's fine, ''Player''... But I'm serious. I've thought about this a lot...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=I was just happy to be there for you...
|It's sayin' stuff like that that's got me here standin' at your door...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So... What do you say? Are we official then?}}

*{{flirt}}''I like you, too!''
*''Sorry, I think we should stay just friends...''
*{{flirt}}''Official.''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|...I've been wanting to do that for a while now... You really sweep me off my feet, you know that?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Hm... So. This is the new "us," huh? In a weird way, it almost feels the same... The same, but better! I think... I just like you even more now. ...If I had to spot a difference, I mean.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Well. Your girlfriend needs to run back to her office... Why don't you stop by a little later and we'll go on our first date! Our first "official" one, anyway...!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Sorry, I think we should stay just friends...
|Ah... really? I just thought... Um. Yeah! Maybe that is better... I guess I was just seeing things that weren't there.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|I would never want to lose you as a friend, so... yeah! Don't worry about me! I'll get over it.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Let's hang out soon. As just friends!}}
