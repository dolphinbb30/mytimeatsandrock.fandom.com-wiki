Title: Dervish Detonates Indispensable Dispenser of Di-hydrogen Monoxide
Logan has returned.

After some time of relative inactivity, Logan has attacked Sandrock directly, in a bold and egregious fashion.

The timing of this attack is precise, and yet confusing. Does he aim to break our spirits in light of our recent success with the Shonash Bridge? Or perhaps he intends to cripple our economy by maintaining the image to the public that Sandrock is an unsafe place? It's likely that only the capture of Logan by Sandrock authorities will give us the answers we seek.

When pressed for comment, Sheriff Justice had this to say on the matter: "Yeah, he ain't my friend no more."

Justice went on to say that he is in talks with City Hall to increase efforts towards the capture of Logan and his gang, and no doubt they will find a way to take action soon.

NPC in-mission talks:

{{dialogue|Qi|I trust your director delivered my diagrams as promised?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I believe you will find this Water Tower, once constructed, to be quite un-explodable.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|You're handling the main tank and such for the Water Tower, huh? Yan just got me rebuilding pipes and the pump, I'm jealous!}}

If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|Perhaps I'll make a something in the shape of your new Water Tower, or rather the tank on top. Could make for a fine teacup that shows off the spirit of Sandrock. In any case, thank you; for setting our hearts at ease with your punctual reconstruction.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Your Water Tower saved us just in the nick of time! With the price of water back to normal, I can finally wash my vegetables again... er, moreso!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Whenever I saw you taking a break from working on the Water Tower, I wanted to come up and say, "Water you waiting for!?" But after careful consideration, I realized that such a comment would be in bad taste. Thanks again for all your help!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I panic bought a bunch of water at a high price through an outside source of mine, but now that you've fixed the Water Tower... wonder if I can cancel that order...?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Fine buildin' there, Builder. Yep, I seen what you done. I got an eye for quality, and that Water Tower y'all put up? Quality. I can tell from havin' seen some Water Towers in my day; you know, not a lot of people know this about me, I used to live next to one? No foolin'. Yep, well, if you don't know, now you know.}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Thanks for fixing the Water Tower, ''Player''! I was so worried, about whether Logan's gonna come back, that we'll run out of water... ah! I can finally rest easy, and get a good night's sleep! Even if you don't know it, you act according to the Light!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Obviously Logan's plan was to blow up the Water Tower... because he knew you'd build it up and make an even better one! He saw the old one and was like, "Naw, that ain't it." Say, uh, you got any more of that... evidence?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|I'm going to sleuth at the Water Tower to see if there are any clues... what? You've already repaired it? Ah, then the crime scene is somewhat sullied...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Nice work on the Water Tower, Builder. I wonder what Logan's next move will be? We've shown that we don't go down easy, and whatever sympathy he might've garnered before, haha, well...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Looks like the new Water Tower is nearly indestructible! And yet, that goof Burgess still gets nervous whenever anybody gets near it. Guy's like an abused puppy...}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Mighty fine shell of steel you Builders came up with for that Water Tower; say, all that metal, was that my stuff you were usin'? I... genuinely can't recall.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|I saw the new Water Tower. It's like you can build anything! Can you make a time machine? What about a translator that can talk to cats?}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|It's nice to know the next shipment of water will have a happy home, all thanks to you Builders! Yippee!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Hey, saw the Water Tower. Man, with you around, Sandrock is like cat with nine lives... Say, I wonder how many lives Captain has left? I hope still nine.}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|That Water Tower's a big project, eh Builda? You're not too shabby! Together with Mi-an, you guys got it fixed! Y'know, no matter how much damage that Logan does, it's never too much for our Builda, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|That new Water Tower is a piece of work, you should be proud! It's a little taller, ain't it? I can see it from the ranch! Coop's a bit jealous of the makeover; now he wants to change all our fences into metal too, "Logan-proof" as he calls it. But they'll just get hot and burn the Yakmel, won't they?}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Even if we do never catch that darn Logan, how could he even think to continue his little campaign against us? Whatever he throws at us, we always bounce back. At a certain point he and any other enemies of this town have got to throw in the towel, I reckon.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Another structure toppled, another structure rebuilt, better than before! I'm startin' to think we kinda kick butt at this whole building thing, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|You've once again proven yourself to be an essential asset in our cause, Builder. Any who oppose us must be coming to the realization that attacking our infrastructure is a fruitless endeavor...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|We all lauded Mason when he was able to build for us the old Water Tower, and yet, you new Builders were able to construct an even better one in even less time! It is as they say: the true heroes are the heroes of today!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I guess Logan thought taking out that Water Tower would be the end of us; didn't take you Builders into account though, did he? We really did luck out with you two, I mean, if we still just had Mason...}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|Hm? You built a Water Tower? Why'd you go and do something like that, I thought we already had one? He did? No! Well, what, am I supposed to keep track of every little thing that goes on in this town? The new line of Freedo came out this week!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking: "Oh, mighty Pen: why couldn't you have just been there and stopped Logan that morning?" Well, just think: if I had, you wouldn't be getting all this glory for fixing the Water Tower! You're welcome.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|To destroy the new Water Tower, Logan would need a bomb with a yield of roughly four megatons, something I'm relatively sure doesn't exist anymore. Don't believe me? Feel free to invent a four megaton bomb.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Homie, there's no rush, take your time. I'm still working on the fence anyway... what? You're done already? So I'm gonna have to like, work faster, right?}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Man, you cleaned right up after Logan's biggest attack yet; you're like some kinda... boxer guy... who keeps gettin knocked down but keeps gettin back up again!}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|If you guys can construct a water tower that's Logan-proof, why didn't we just make everything in town Logan-proof to begin with?}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|You Builders already got that Water Tower up again? Shoot, that's faster than Mason built the old one in the first place! Though, now that I think about it, it took him two instances of Running with the Yakmels before he came around and fixed my shelf...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|How's it going with that fifty Gols bonus I gave you? Haven't spent it already, have you? Does someone need a lesson in money management?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Hydrogel, Shonash Bridge, Water Tower... Everybody seems to know how to hit us where it hurts. Hard for me to stay focused when stuff like this keeps happenin'...}}
