{{dialogue|Ernest|Excuse me, ma'am. Might I have a word? I'm new to Sandrock, and I would be remiss to pass up an opportunity to speak with a dignified looking damsel such as yourself...}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|My stars! ''Player'', would you listen to that? I reckon that must be the phrasings of a bonafide Ataran gentleman! Ain't nobody talks fancy like that 'round here...}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Well, what can I do ya for, newcomer? Lookin' for good eats? Or just a place to kick up your heels? I've been ranchin' these parts for more than twenty years! Reckon I ought to know a thing or two by now... Just ask ''Player'', our Builder here!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Mm. I believe you. I'm Ernest, by the way. I'm here on the behalf of the Atara Times, I was hoping to do a piece on that bandit fellow who's been giving you all so much trouble. Would you care to weigh in on the situation?}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Oh... I reckon you mean Logan... Mr. Ernie, sir, I don't suppose you were on that train were you? You still wanna catch up with that rascal...?}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Well, here's my weighin' in: you'd do best by packin' your bags. That Logan's a wanted man! And he likely won't take kindly to a fancy-talkin', pants-wearin', cityslickin' poindexter snoopin' around! ... No offense!}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|If you gotta write about somethin', write about the scenery! Try some of our Yakmel Sausage; it's so good, people all the way from Portia make their way over to stock up on it! Logan? Forget about it! Wait 'til the Corps catches 'im, then ask 'im yourself!}}

Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Burgess|I asked Mr. Ernest to do a deep-dive on our Church and all the cool happenings that go on, especially on the weekends! But he said he didn't think he could sell papers with my story... How strange! Sounded like page one material to me!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Heard some folks sayin' that article about the trainrobbin' was mighty fearful. Good thing I can't read. Dodged a bullet there!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|I hope my article makes it here to Sandrock. Kind of a shame, my editor made me water it down a bit, remove a bit of the flourish, but all in all I think it came out well enough.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Yeah, I read Ernie's World. I understood all the words but it don't make a lick of sense! Who do you think reads travel articles, the Deacon of Meidi!?}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|I admire the bravado of the Atara Times, but, eh, a bit of levity wouldn't kill ya, am I right? I mean, I just think being so dramatic all the time can really blow things out of proportion... And not one alliteration, either...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Mr. Ernie works for the paper! I guess that's how he makes money when nobody buys his books.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Yo, did you see that article about the trainrobbin' incident? Man, that Ernie character made me sound cool as heck! I mean, I always thought I was cool, but I never thought I was that cool!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|That article by that young city-slicker boy... When he wrote, 'worn woman clutching a pastry,' you don't think he was talkin' about me and my Sandrolls, do you? Cuz I wouldn't take too kindly to that..}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Factually, I reckon that little writer boy ain't really done wrong, but... I can't help but feel like the danger of it all was a bit sensationalized in that Atara Times article. Why can't he write more "Ernie World?" Those are nice and friendly.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Did you see the article Ernest wrote about Logan? Chilling stuff! I'm just glad everyone's okay! ...And that I don't have to read stuff like that in literature class anymore. Sheesh, what a headache!}}

{{dialogue|Mort|What a way with words that young writer has... If only we'd had someone like him on our side back in the early days. Perhaps he could've helped people see the bigger picture...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Kinda crazy, I've got me a prolific wordsmith type guy stayin' over at the saloon! Did you read the Ernie's World piece on Sandrock? Just line after line of all this honey-soaked stuff about our hometown! Hope he interviews me sometime...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Ernie's World just speaks to me... the ink just cascades off the page, into my eyeballs and sparks up literary joy in my heart! I do hope I get to meet him personally one day. But I mean, he obviously puts work into his hair; should only be a matter of time...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Ernest's article was pretty good. I could probably write better if I tried. Which I won't. But... just so you know.}}

{{dialogue|Tourist|I dunno about that Ernest dude. Seems like kind of a try-hard to me. Why not just write some funny stuff? Nobody wants to read, like... poetry about sand or whatever.}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I guess that writer, Mr. Ernest, forgot to include my interviews in any of his articles. Oh well, what can you do?}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I dunno about that little writer boy. Wants us all to think he's so smart with his big words and fancy prose. Now you don't have to believe ol' armchair psychologist Grandma Vivi, but I figure that boy is compensatin' for somethin'...}}

{{dialogue|Yan|That Ernest fellow made us Sandrockers look bad! I'll have his head for such libel! That is, unless he agrees to do my biography. "A young lad, born from nothing who would grow up to do great things..." Dang, maybe I'll just write it myself!}}
