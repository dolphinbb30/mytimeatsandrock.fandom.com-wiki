{{dialogue|Ernest|''Player'', for this interview, please try to be as objective as possible. Try not to let your feelings or any biases get in the way, it's important that I only get the facts as I try to understand this bandit persona...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Ahem! First question: do you know Logan personally?}}

*''Nope. Never met him.''
*''Yeah, I know him like a brother.''
*''No comment.''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Nope. Never met him.
|That's alright. Still, you've lived here for a while, haven't you? I believe your insight may yet be of use.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I know him like a brother.
|What? Really? This is great! Why didn't you say so in the first place? Okay! Follow up:}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=No comment.
|Oh... really? You're all in on it, huh? You should know that I really have no ulterior motives, especially with a question like that... Eh, let's just go through the motions...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Tell me what he looks like. I mean, have you seen the posters around here? They really couldn't have found a picture of him without a bandana over his face? Just a simple description will do.}}

*''He's hot!''
*''Not as good looking as me.''
*''No comment!''
*''Tell Ernest what you know''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=He's hot!
|Oh, no! He's hot! Ugh, why does everybody keep saying that... I'd say, rather, Logan has a disarming glare... Ice cold... I'll never forget it. And even through the bandana you can see there are stories written on his face, just waiting to be told...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Not as good looking as me.
|Hah! Alright, alright. Thanks, I needed that one. But I mean, the two of you... there's no sense in comparing you. You're just two totally different styles. When I saw him, I could tell even through the bandana there are stories just waiting to be told...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=No comment!
|Ah, this again. Alright, maybe I set myself up for this... I'll just make up an answer for you. "When I saw him, I could tell even through the bandana there are stories just waiting to be told..." Now can you please take this seriously? Last question:}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Tell Ernest what you know
|Hm, so you've never seen his face either? I got a quick look at him. That disarming glare... Ice cold... I'll never forget it. And even through the bandana you can see there are stories written on his face, just waiting to be told..}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Logan's accomplice, the man who helped him on the train. What do you know about him? What's his name?}}

*''I believe his name is "Eggboy." The sidekick.''
*''That's Haru, his oldest friend.''
*''No comment!''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=I believe his name is "Eggboy." The sidekick.
|Hm, fancies himself some sort of superhero's sidekick? Eggboy? What could it all mean...? I didn't see any eggs on him... I'll just make a note of this...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=That's Haru, his oldest friend.
|Haru and Logan. I see. Yes, I noticed that they seemed to be close. Each one seemed to know what the other was about to do from just a quick glance...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=No comment!

|Yes, "The Maltese Pigeon" is my most famous work. It's a classical whodunnit mystery where it turns out it was the butler all along. Oops... guess I spoiled it for you. Well, it's still good. I recommend you check it out.}}
