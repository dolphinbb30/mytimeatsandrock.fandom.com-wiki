Title: Fireside Function Found Fully Fun
Though nothing too novel an occasion, this week's Fireside chat was novelly festive as Sandrock welcomed new members into the community, and with catering by Blue Moon, good times were had by all. 

"I was especially moved by Mi-an's speech- I never thought Builders could be so inspiring! Not to say that Mason was a particularly bad speech giver but... Hm, shoot, I don't really know how to finish this sentence..." said local resident, Mabel, on the gathering.

"We just want to provide a sense of community and keep everyone in the loop around here, everyone in Sandrock should come to our Fireside Meetings, every Sunday at 18:00pm!" added Matilda.

All in all, this reporter has to agree: the quality of Fireside Meetings in Sandrock is on the up and up! We here at the Tumbleweed Standard encourage everyone to stop in as well!
