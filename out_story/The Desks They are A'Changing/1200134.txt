{{dialogue|Matilda|Good evening, everyone!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|And would you look who I've brought with me today: our very own Mayor Trudy back from her arduous journey through the desert! Let's give her that warm Sandrock welcome she's surely been missin'!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Thank you everyone! It's nice to be back! And look at what all's sprung up since I've been gone! The new bridge, the reinforced Water Tower, truly amazing! As I return to my post, I hope to continue to pave the way forward to a better Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Well put, Trudy! Now you must tell us: what of your trip to the desert? What about all those experimental seeds you took with you? Surely there must be the beginnings of a new oasis out there by now!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ah, well, I hadn't really prepared anything on that particular subject; I think you can go ahead with whatever you planned to share today...}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Pish-posh, old girl! We've all been so worried for you and so looking forward to hearing about all you've accomplished! Please, don't trifle yourself with any formalities, just speak freely on the subject.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, if you insist...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|The seeds I brought out this time... they didn't survive, once again. However-}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Don't be down on yourself, Trudy. Even the cleverest cook can't cook a meal without the right ingredients. Moreso, the cleverest gardener couldn't grow weeds without water... These are simply the facts of our situation.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Hm, perhaps I really need to start considering importing produce from Portia...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Hahahaha! You said you was gonna plant us a whole mess of trees out there and stop them sandstorms, and you can't even grow yerself a green bean, hah hah! Oh man, this is bad... Are we, like, doomed or somethin'?}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Now hold on y'all, surely that ain't all!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|I believe Trudy still had more to say before being so rudely interrupted! Trudy, please, continue.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I... well, in the midst of my travels, I was able to collect and label a great number of soils and plants that should be beneficial to Zeke's research!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Erm... yeah, no need to cheer. That's about it. I'm sorry.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Maaaan, all this time out and you wanna act like a buncha dirt is gonna help us? I ain't never learned nothin' from dirt! 'Cept not to eat it. Heck, I got plenty of dirt down at the farm, if you asked nicely I woulda gladly lent you some!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Cooper, soils around here got different nutrients in 'em, if I can just-}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Aw, phooey! My dirt's just as nutritious as it gets what with the fertilization influence of the Yakmel and what not. It's a regular plant buffet over there, all you can eat!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Hey, c'mon guys, let's look on the bright side! At least our Mayor returned to us safe and sound.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Look, if the so-called road to a green desert ends up going nowhere, then we'll build a road somewhere else, right? Just 'cause one idea didn't work doesn't mean we're never going to figure this out!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Apologies if this has been asked already, but... plants don't grow in sand, right? Asking for a friend.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Alright, alright, simmer down, y'all...}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|I'm sure something will come of Trudy's selfless work. Let's call it here for now. For any official town business, please direct your questions to the Mayor from now on. Conserve water, and, er, have an omelet, courtesy of Owen.}}
