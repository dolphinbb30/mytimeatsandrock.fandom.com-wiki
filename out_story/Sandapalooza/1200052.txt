{{dialogue|Catori|Logan... Why couldn't he have blown up the water tower next week!? Or, better yet, ehhhh... not at all?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Well, on the bright side, since there's no one here, there's no one to see how miserable of a failure this is...}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Oh, speaking of Burgess, he wanted to talk to you: he feels responsible for getting the ball rolling on this thing, I guess. I mean, this is nobody's fault but Logan's! But I couldn't convince him otherwise.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|What's more, I realized that my survey, which was intended to support the need for giving people in town a rest, actually ended up putting you Builders back to work!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Well, I'm real sorry that things turned out like this... "Foresight is not your strong suit!" Miguel always says that about me!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Ahem... if it means anything, I did want to tell you that I think you did a really great job on the sand sled thing, even if nobody showed up...!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|All the stuff you've been doing for Sandrock, well, a lot of people appreciate it. We're all rooting for you!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|So! I saved up some money and got you {{textcolor|green|a week long pass}} to ride on Catori's sand sled game as many times as you want! I got one for Mi-an, too, since you guys have been working so hard lately!}}
