{{dialogue|Trudy|The Civil Corps have locked up the Duvos soldiers for the time being, until the reinforcements arrive. Haru and Rian should be nearing their destination by now...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Brilliant work! Special thanks to Logan, ''Player'', and our Mole friends.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|But in my mind, everyone here in Sandrock is a hero today!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Trudy, this ain't over yet, they still have that dumb blimp to the north! Matilda and Pen are still out there!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I've been observing the airship, it looks like they're excavating something. And it seems like they're in a hurry.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|The {{textcolor|green|Northern Plateau}} is way too high for us to climb, by the time we get over there, they'd be long gone...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Logistics aside... we're all safe! Let's quit while we're ahead! Who cares if Duvos steals some of our relics? Let the Alliance forces deal with them now.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Afraid I can't stand by on this one, Heidi.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Ah?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|This has been one of the largest Duvos operations in Free Cities history. They've found something big. At the very least, I have to find out what it is...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|What if there are a thousand soldiers over there? It could be very dangerous! I'm sure the Alliance will be here very soon!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Then that's a thousand more reasons to go take 'em out now!}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|And as much as I know Ri-ri's trying his best, we don't know when the Alliance will come.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Hmm...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|You always tell me to take the initiative, Mayor! I don't really know what that means. But it feels appropriate to say that, somehow!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|You're right Burgess. Let's do it, let's get over there and stop them!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Daisy! She can help out!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Daisy?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|That's my giant duck! It's gotten to know all the folks around town already. I reckon she can take us there, no problem!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I drew up a diagram of a {{textcolor|green|Hangin' Basket}} before. Jus' in case Daisy could take people across the desert, in case of emergency and such.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Well, I can tell you one thing right now: that basket gets built, I'm ridin' shotgun.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Alright! Take the initiative. A surprise... duck attack!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Heidi, check Elsie's diagram and send it to a Builder pronto. Justice, you choose who you want to take with you and come up with a plan. Everyone else, let's get this town back into shape!}}
