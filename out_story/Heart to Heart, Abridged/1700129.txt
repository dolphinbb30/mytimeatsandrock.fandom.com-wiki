Add behavior NPC_Conversation (idName: 1712909) to Heidi
(param: Dialog_TargetID:8000|Dialog_AnimName:Hi)
(cId 1) A conversation 847_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey there, ''Player''! Fancy seein' you here. Hey, come check out this view!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|It's only right here that you can see both valleys of the canyon. But if I'm being honest, I really just came here to admire our handiwork from a different angle!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|You know, when I said my master Verna would be proud, actually now I'm not so sure about that... She's more into deconstructivist architecture. Oh. Sorry, that's...}}

*''Destroying buildings?''
*''A design style?''
*''A band name?''
*''Let her continue''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Destroying buildings?
|Haha! No, no... Er, you don't literally
deconstruct anything...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=A design style?
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=5}}|Yeah!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=A band name?
|"Deconstructivist Architecture?" Hm. That does sound like a band my Pa might listen to.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|"Deconstructivism" is a design thing. You "deconstruct" all the rules that you're supposed to follow, then actively set out to not follow those rules! The result is usually something pretty odd looking. But neat! Y'know, if you're good at it.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Verna's probably one of the first architects since the Old World that uses this style. And I was pretty good at it, too! It's just that this bridge doesn't really need the extra bells and whistles, know what I mean?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Here's one for you: Verna used to always ask us this as new apprentices, "Would you rather build something really beautiful? Or really useful?"}}

*''Beautiful.''
*''Useful.''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Beautiful.
|Hah. Well, you might be in the wrong town, then, partner! We haven't got the budget for much more than the bare bones when it comes to our projects. But! You'd get a thumbs up from Master Verna!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Useful.
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=5}}|Exactly! Yes. The world being the way it is, that's what we have to be doing! Making the Free Cities a better place for those who need it with useful constructions! Master Verna, however, doesn't see things that way.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|"Anyone can make something that 'gets the job done!'" She'd say. "All of you are here to turn your plain ponderings of purposeless pavement piles into things of divine beauty!"}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|And... though I do and always will appreciate a good alliteration, that ended up not being the path for me.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Now don't get me wrong, I love superfluous geometric patterns on my buildings as much as the next gal! It's just... I couldn't stay in Atara working on vanity projects knowing that the people I care about were here hurting.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So after I finished my apprenticeship, I packed my bags, tossed all my job offers in the trash can, and bought a one-way ticket back to Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|My Master... she's a piece of work. You know the last thing she said to me? She showed up at the train station with one of those weird little pigs of hers tucked under her arm, just to squeak out one last, "You're wasting your talent."}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|But when I see this bridge we built; this plain ol', run-of-the-mill, just-doin'-its-job-and-nothin'-else, very non-deconstructivist bridge, I know in my heart that I did the right thing in coming back home.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|We saved Sandrock, you know? This won't be our last fight, but it very well could've been. It's good having you on the team, ''Player''. I hope you'll stay here. At least 'til we can turn things around for this town.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|...Well, shucks. I didn't mean to tell you my whole life story. You probably got places to be, huh? I'll probably stick around and soak in the view a bit longer...}}

*''I can hang for a bit.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''Yep, see ya.''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Yep, see ya.
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=20}}|See ya! Thanks again.}}
