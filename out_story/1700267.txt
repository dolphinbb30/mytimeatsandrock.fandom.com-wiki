Title: Verdict Invalidated, Veritable Villain Revealed!
"Where. Is. Logan!?"

The unhinged water thief shouted out to the crowd, a vein bulging in his neck as he stared down resident superstar Builder, ''Player'' in an accusative fervor.

"Lookin' for me?" former hero turned bandit turned hero again, Logan, cooly called out from the crowd.

The authorities immediately collapsed on him, but to no avail! In a flash, Logan was off his feet, tumbling towards the Statue of Peach that adorns the center island of Martle's Oasis.

Then, in a shock to all at the scene, Logan tore down the statue, revealing a network of piping that has been regulating the oasis water level for years!

The so called "water crisis" was a scam all along...

Filled with embarassment, rage, and shame, Pastor Miguel took aim at Logan with a handgun and pulled the trigger! Only to be stopped by none other than Minister Matilda! 

In the shuffle, Matilda sustained injuries, but the Sandrock Clinic has confidently reported that she will recover soon.

As Pastor Miguel, cornered by a crowd of enraged and betrayed Sandrockers, attempted to make his escape, yet another villain tore off his proverbial mask and attacked the town on Miguel's behalf...!

Pen! Bellowing as he brandished his relic weapon, attempting to secure an escape route for our already infamous water thief, he lept into the air and aimed his cannon squarely at the mayor of Sandrock! 

"Mrs. Mayor, noooooooo!" screamed sheriff Justice as he jumped through the air in slow motion to absorb the blow meant to land behind him.

A shot rings out on the air. The sound of a body hitting the ground. Dust flies through the air...

And Justice brings himself to his feet, unscathed...! 

Pen's relic weapon lets out a pathetic sigh... only soot and smoke leaks out of its opening...

"Lookin' for this?" says Andy, rolling out the fifth twist for the scene: Pen's relic weapon was sabotaged at some point off camera! Then the man in the back said, "Everyone, attack," and it turned into a town square blitz! It was electric! So frantically hectic! And then ''Player'' punched Pen in the face and knocked him out.

But wait, there's more! Still implicated in the conspiracy to corrupt Sandrock was none other than Commissioner Yan of the commerce guild! Long story short: somebody finally legally punched him in the mouth.

Sandrock is saved!  

Details of the criminals' arrest and motive will remain classified information until the Civil Corps is ready to release a report.

"They're bad guys. We got 'em. What more do you really need to know?" 

- Justice
