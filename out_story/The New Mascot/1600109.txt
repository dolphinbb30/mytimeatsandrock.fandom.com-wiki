{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey, ''Player''! How's the workshop these days? Uh huh? Great! Say, have you noticed that a lot more tourists have been around lately? And yet, hardly any of them stop into By the Stairs! Hard to believe, I know!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|What could I possibly do to remedy such a situation... ah, I know! How about a big billboard right there on the train platform! That way, the second they step off the train...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Yes! They'll see it straight away! They'll think "Wow, By the Stairs! Such a nondescript shop name means they don't care about being popular; they must have great stuff!"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Hm? Still have doubts? Well, this idea of mine has only been existent for thirty seconds or so; I still have some details to iron out! Given time, well... the sky's the limit, I suppose!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|You have a keen eye, ''Player'': what image would you put on the billboard? What's something that would really grab everyone's attention?}}

*''Some quality goods.''
*''A map to the store.''
*''Why not a beaming image of you, Arvio?''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Some quality goods.
|Hm, that is the traditional approach, true... but most of the things I sell are rather ordinary and hardly eye-catching...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|I've got it! Nothing grabs attention in an ad like a friendly face! And being that I am the sole proprietor of By the Stairs, limited liability storefront, whose friendly face could it be other than... me! Er, mine!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=A map to the store.
|Hm, well, the thing is, ''Player''. The directions to my shop are in the name: "By the Stairs!" I fear we'd just be wasting valuable ad space...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|I've got it! Nothing grabs attention in an ad like a friendly face! And being that I am the sole proprietor of By the Stairs, limited liability storefront, whose friendly face could it be other than... me! Er, mine!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Why not a beaming image of you, Arvio?
|Why, that's a brilliant idea! Why didn't I think of that? Nothing grabs attention in an ad like a friendly face!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Say, we make a pretty good team, wouldn't you say? We could sell honey to Bumble Ants, I bet!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Yes, our discussion has been rather enlightening, I must say! Tonight I should have time to draw up a design for a billboard; once it's done, can I trouble you to build it for me?}}

*''Of course!''
*''I'm really busy now...''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Of course!
|Wonderful! I'll get the design to you as soon as possible! Make sure you remember to check your mailbox. Thanks again for your insightful advice!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I'm really busy now...
|Ah, couldn't that other stuff wait a bit? Hm, maybe that is a bit much to ask for... Alright, well, please let me know if you do get time!}}
