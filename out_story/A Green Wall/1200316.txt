{{dialogue|Zeke|Oh hey ''Player'', are you here to help us do some planting?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|To be honest, I'm a bit nervous... I'm really not sure how well our algae will perform out here.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Even though it's all sand, there's still a difference between the soil here and those at the Little Woods. There are always unknown factors... Pa's right, fighting against nature is a sisyphean task.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Will a forest really stop sandstorms?''
*''Should we do more research?''
*''But we've got enough water from Portia, right?''

{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|answer=Will a forest really stop sandstorms?
|Uhm... I've read some very old records from the Old World... even before the Corrupted Age, that told stories of how communities on the edge of encroaching deserts planted vegetation to reclaim the land.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|While they never talked about the technical details, they uh, do mention tangible changes to the local climate, including less sandstorms.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|Anyhow, Trudy, Mi-an, Dan-bi, and Burgess have all been here preparing seeds, straws, and everything else we need. I can give you some, if you have time, you can plant some yourself.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|Our goal for this experiment is to plant 100 trees. It'll be a good start, and we can get a lot of valuable data.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|answer=Should we do more research?
|Mi-an and I have done several trips out here to measure the water table and the soil mineral levels. We've also brought back sand samples to the Moisture Farm and used our algae on them to pretty good results...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|So... there's not much more we can do other than a live test.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|answer=But we've got enough water from Portia, right?
|I've recorded the amount of water used per tree at the Little Woods over time. It depends on Trudy's final budget, but I reckon it should be enough to support a sizable forest based on the current cost of Portian water.}}
