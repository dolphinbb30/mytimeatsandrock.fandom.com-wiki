{{dialogue|Owen|Alright, alright. So I've got a great story for you tonight, and I want ''Player'' here to help me tell it!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Just play along, let's do a little improv!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So once upon a time... a long, long time ago, there was a really clever little girl who wanted to be...}}

*''A journalist!''
*''A Builder!''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=A journalist!
|That's right, she wanted to be a journalist. She used to run around the town, writing articles about everything she'd see!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|Gasp! I wanna be a journalist, too!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|What a coincidence!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|She'd write about the cat in the tree, she'd write about the lost puppy, she'd write about the newest dishes at the handsome man's Saloon...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|Hehehe, that's you, Owen!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Haha, not this time! This Saloon owner was called... Hank! And he didn't cook quite as well as me.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|answer=A Builder!
|Wow, she wanted to be a Builder?! That's so cool!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|That's right. She wanted to a Builder. She used to run around town, building all the little things the town needed!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|She'd build a house for the birds, a bench for the cats, she'd fix fences, and she'd take commissions from the handsome man at the Saloon...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Anyway... one day, our little hero came across...}}

*''A monster!''
*''A baby!''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=A monster!
|Yeah, a giant monster popped out!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|Ahhhhh!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|But our little hero was too quick for it! And she managed to get away, and call the Civil Corps!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|The Civil Corps was so impressed, that they gave her 100 Gols!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=A baby!
|Yeah, a little baby, lost from its Ma.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|Awwww.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Our little hero scooped it up, and brought it to the Civil Corps to try and find its Ma. The little baby's Ma was so happy, she gave our little hero 100 Gols as a reward!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Woah! I wanna save a baby!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So then our little hero went and celebrated with her friends...}}
