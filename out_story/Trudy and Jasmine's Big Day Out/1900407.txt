{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|answer=Let's plant Raspberry!
|Good choice! They're really tasty, too. I was going to plant them, but I wanted Cantaloupes, and Ma said that I shouldn't eat too many sweet things. I think if you chose them then she wouldn't mind...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|I don't mind, but don't eat too many before bed!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|answer=Rose Willow is really pretty!
|It is! I haven't grown this one before, Zeke said it's a little harder to grow than the others, but I think we can do it together!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|I think you're ready for it, Jasmine.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|answer=Sand Leek all day!
|It doesn't look so pretty, but Ma is always telling me to eat healthy, and Sand Leek can be used in loads of different food! Maybe Owen can make something super tasty with it.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|I'm sure he can! We'll bring it to him when it's fully grown.}}
