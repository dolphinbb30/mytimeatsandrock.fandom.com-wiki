{{dialogue|Cooper|Howdy little missy, if ya come to Sandrock, gotta be prepared for the sandstorms! But I can't help but notice from here, ya got one of 'em weak light wood guitars.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Bringing that kinda guitar here, it ain't gonna last ya longer than a few days, at most! When I started playin', bought myself a similar guitar from Walnut Groove, real fancy like. Broke in three days.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|My lil Elsie wasn't born back then, so I had a little change to spare. Went over to show 'em how to play real music a few times, I tell ya, their guitars sure look fancy, but they'll set ya back...}}

|What? You got some secret esoteric knowledge of music you ain't told us before?}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|Nah, ''Player'' jus' wants to spare this young woman one of your rants!}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|Haha, I don't mind! I like hearing people's stories, I always get such amazing inspiration from these tales. So you're musicians too? If my guitar isn't broken I'd love to play together...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=(Let Cooper speak)
|I think it's about thirteen guitars I've had now... fourteen? Hmmm... There was Nancy, Petunia, Doris, Boris...}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|Ahem... Excuse my friend here, he can play a mean riff, but he's been known to ramble... a lot...}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|Are you guys... a band? I'm a musician, too!}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|Ahhh if my guitar isn't broken I'd love to play together...}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Seems like you're real passionate about your music. Cooper's got a point though. A verbose point, but still...}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Sandrock's a real arid place. If you're gonna have these kinda thin wood guitars, they aren't gonna last a long time. They'll deform, and crack. When you build your next one, it's probably good to keep that in mind.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Y'know, it's good to meet someone who's got an ear fer music. Ain't a lotta folks 'round here that really know their stuff. Me an' Hugo got a little somethin' cookin', wanna hear it?}}

{{dialogue|Penny|It's on! It's the only way to settle this!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|How about this then, let's take some time to prepare a song, then get everyone in town to be the judges.}}
{{dialogue|Penny|Umm... Mister... I've actually only been composing music for a little while, and I don't have any songs of my own... Can I adapt a tune I really like?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Course you can missy! Heck, use all of 'em famous songs an' mash 'em together if ya like. Don't bother me none.}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|You got lucky, missy. Standin' next to you there is one heck of a Builder. I tell ya, since ''Player'' came to town, things have changed around here-}}
