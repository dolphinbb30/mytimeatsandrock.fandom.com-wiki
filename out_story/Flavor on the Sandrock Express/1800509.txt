{{dialogue|Owen|''Player''! How's it going? Hey, there was something I wanted to your help on...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Someone from Walnut Groove stopped in the other day, a comedian. He shared with me some of his routine; it went something like "What's the deal with train food?" And, well, that got me thinking: "What is the deal with train food?"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So what if I reached out to Jensen over at the Train Station; see if there wasn't a way to remedy that situation with a little bit of fine cuisine...! Although I might be ruining that guy's bit...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Could even convince more folks to stop off on their way to and from Atara if they get a taste of real, authentic Sandrock cuisine!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|But before I get the ball rolling, I was thinking I'd scope the place out; take a look at the dining car they've already got. Could use a Builder's insight for some of the technical bits; what do you say?}}

*''Sure! When shall we go?''
*''Bit much on the plate, as it were...''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Sure! When shall we go?
|Great! Why don't we head over to the train station tomorrow, say... five o'clock? The train'll be stopped in for the crew to take a break so we can poke around without bothering anyone. But... that doesn't give us too much time, so don't be late!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Bit much on the plate, as it were...
|Oh! Right. Sure; sorry to spring that on you. Let me know if you get time!}}
