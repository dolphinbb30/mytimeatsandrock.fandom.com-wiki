Title: ARCS â€“ At Risk Citizens of Sandrock
By Burgess, Edited by Heidi
Written by Burgess
Edited by Heidi

Safety is a priority in everyone's lives, but here in Sandrock, the wild frontier town, safety requires just a bit of extra effort to maintain! Most of us do as we're told, clean up after ourselves, avoid using excessive amounts of toilet paper, but there are still those who deviate: those who take big bites of spaghetti and allow the tomatoey pizza sauce to drivel all over their chins, chewing with their mouths open and smiling rebelliously, and when you ask them to wipe the sauce away they slyly utter, "No." There are those who would dunk their heads in our oasis with reckless abandonment, sucking up all the minerals into their hair follicles with no concern for our crops and thirsty children. Those even who park their Yakmel in inappropriate places! These folk are known by the Church as "At Risk Citizens of Sandrock," or ARCS.

But these deviants are not lost souls! Many of them do not wish to be ARCS! In fact, you too can contribute to the war on ARCS by helping them change their ARCS-y ways! But! The first step in curing the disease is to be able to recognize the symptoms. 

Identifying an ARCS:

One: Check to see if they have pizza sauce on their chins or elsewhere on their person. Two: Is the person's head currently submersed in the Oasis? Three: Do they seem to have a disregard for rules and society in general?

If you answered "yes" to one or more of these, you may be dealing with an ARCS!

But do not panic; an ARCS can smell fear. Your first priority is establishing dominance. If you have a jacket or any loose clothing, try to finagle it in such a way that you appear larger than you would normally; i.e. unzip your jacket and pull it out to your sides like wings. ARCS are easily intimidated creatures! If you lack the ability to enlarge yourself, climb the nearest tall structure and shout at them from the top of it. In the direst of situations, you may need to climb up on top of a cactus. Fight through the pain!

From there, the next step is to strongly apply guilt to the subject: ask them things like "What would your mother think if she saw you with all that pizza sauce on your face?" and "Do you really think it's cool, acting like some kind of rebel all the time?" If these negotiations fail, it is best to simply escape the situation. DO NOT FURTHER ENGAGE THE ARCS! It is possible that they will turn you to the dark side, and that is simply bad news.
