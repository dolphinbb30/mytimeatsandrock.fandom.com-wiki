{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Huh?!}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Think about your responsibilities! Don't give up!
|Yes... I'm responsible for our Holy Book!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Holy Book? The cover says "Geegle Company Handbook." I have one of these from Vega 5. Do you understand what this is?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Yes, I can read. This book was with them when our ancestors took their first steps. It speaks of the sins of your people! "They have partaken in deception, and shall be punished accordingly. They will not qualify."}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|There should be more... you seem to have a torn up version! "They will not qualify for promotion." It means an employee violation. If they have violated the company rules, they will not be able to get a higher position in the company, that is all.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Whaa- impossible... You're trying to trick me human!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Now why would I waste time to do that?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|It's... not divine punishment? B-but what about: "We must replace them, city by city, until Geegle..."}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|..Is the only available option to consumers. Yes. Historically Geegle was a technology company aiming for monopolization of the market. A common trend in Old World business. Ethics were secondary to profits.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Company? Business? I... I don't understand. It's our Holy Book... it told us to take over the world...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Simple misinterpretation. You are not the first to misunderstand the content of a book.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|I... can't believe it...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Director Qi... what are you doing here anyway?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I was just getting a check up on my heart rate, but this is far more interesting.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Oh.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Your wife wouldn't want to see you like this!
|She was supposed to grow old with me, raise our young... and now she's but a memory, bittersweet...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Well, when I was lookin' into your old spot...}}
