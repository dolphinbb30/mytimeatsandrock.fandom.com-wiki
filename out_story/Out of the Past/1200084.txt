|Wow... where'd you dig up an old relic like that? Yep, that's me in the background! But I can't say I remember too much about this day... People were always getting married in the Blue Moon back then.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Logan's Ma... what was she like? I can barely remember her face if not for this photo; she skipped town not too long after Logan was born. Shocked everyone with that move. Hardly worth mentioning Logan's old man, Howlett, took it the hardest.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|But you'd have never guessed it from this photo. Looks like a match made in heaven. Except for the tear down the center, I guess.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|When Howlett came back with the disease and was put in quarantine by the Church, Logan really lost it. He started shouting for them to release his Pa outside the Temple door. Understandable: Howlett was all he had his whole life.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Well, that's not completely true. I considered Logan a friend once. I really just hope he sees through all this madness and turns himself in. Then maybe the healing can begin.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Did you see Logan on the night of the Temple incident?
|Yeah... not that night, but he came into the saloon that day with Haru, and they were actin' real strange, buying up a lot of supplies. It was later that I heard that they blew up the Temple in an attempt to get Howlett out and the old man died in the blast.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Frankly, even if Logan did manage to get Howlett out of quarantine, it would have endangered us all with the disease. Real sad story. Other than that, though, I'm afraid I don't know much of anything...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Oh. I see. Yes, now that you mention it, I believe I have seen these kind of bombs before. Yes, yes, it's coming back to me... That foul Logan's paramount compatriot used those kinds of bombs as his weapons of choice.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|If you do find out where he is, why not tell me first? Skip the Civil Corps, skip the paperwork... you know, make sure Logan gets some real justice!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Hm? No? I thought we were doing extra-judicial stuff already, it's not such a stretch from what you're doing now. Hmph, fine... What do I know? Let me think...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|The night Logan attacked our Temple, I was at home pumping iron! Yes, I believe I was trying to perfect a 300kg clean and press with one finger, but my darn palmar interosseous muscle was acting up!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|As soon as I heard the explosion, I rushed out of my room to see Burgess knocked out. That's something I see all the time. But what really caught my attention was the exploded Temple!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|I managed to catch a glimpse of Logan riding away with someone, but they were too far gone for me to pursue... Maybe it really is time for me to get a loyal steed to call my own... Nah. I'll just keep training to run faster!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Well I hope you enjoyed listening to my story as much as I enjoyed telling it! Say, Skinny Arms, you're a good listener! I'll have to tell you stories more often!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|You know, ''Player'', you don't need to be sneakin' around, actin' all suspicious if all you're after is information...}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|Yes, this makes sense. Although I must admit, this shows a level of organization from Logan I can't say I was aware he might be capable of.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|No doubt you've started to put things together since your arrival, but... perhaps you'd best hear the tale in its entirety to dispel any misconceptions you might have about the whole ordeal.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|Not too long before you started living in Sandrock, a great tragedy struck this town. Howlett, the monster hunter, and his son Logan, with whom you are already quite familiar with, ran into some trouble...}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|Howlett went diving in some ruins explicitly blocked off by the Civil Corps due to an abundance of unknown and dangerous substances. Sure enough, he became contaminated with somethin' bizarre.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|Logan reacted rather wildly after Pastor Miguel quarantined his father inside the Temple and refused to let Logan come in contact with him due to fears of contamination. He couldn't believe his father would be so careless as to come in contact with dangerous Age of Corruption conconctions.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|One night during the quarantine, Logan attacked the Temple with bombs. I assume it was to free his father from the quarantine?}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|But whatever the case, Logan botched the operation and... parts of the Temple collapsed. Us churchfolk were all outside, but Logan's father was still in there where we'd left him and... when we found him down there, he was already gone.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|Logan blamed us churchfolk for what happened, and now he seems bent on some kind of revenge... and he'd sooner take down the whole town if it means gettin' to us, I reckon.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|indent=true|answer=Did you see Logan the night of the Temple explosion?
|Well, of course, I was there at the scene of it all, as were most of us. I came out after the explosion, but by the time I knew what was going on, Logan was long gone.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|It was a stressful time for all of us, but obviously Logan was affected the most.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|I think the sooner Logan accepts that and takes responsibility for what he did... well, perhaps the sooner we can have him back in the flock.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Maybe the reason no one's talked about this much since you've been here is... we're all really sad about the way things turned out. Maybe some people also fear that it's something they did that drove Logan down this path.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Look: I was close with Howlett. And Logan as well. What happened to that man was a goshdang travesty. But that's just the way things are out here sometimes. All it takes is one slip up and you're gone.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|I always considered myself to be like an uncle to Logan; I woulda taken him in. But I guess he didn't see it that way.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|I worry about what Logan might do, and I worry about how the more things escalate, the less likely I'm ever going to see that pup I used to know ever again.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|There ain't gonna be an amicable settlement at the end of all this, so don't overinvolve yourself.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Be seein' ya.}}
The conversation ends.

{{dialogue|Arvio|Hello, there ''Player''! What stroke of luck has brought you my way?}}

*''(Show him the photo of the recipe list)''
*''Did you see Logan the night of the Temple incident?''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=(Show him the photo of the recipe list)
|Oh boy... It seems my secret supplier has been revealed. Yes, yes, I told Mi-an that those recipes were company secrets... which was true! Only Haru and myself are privvy to such knowledge!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Whaaat? I was the only one left around here who knew how to make that stuff, I'm supposed to just give away my recipes like that? Come now, ''Player'', I've got to pay the bills too, you know?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|It's really so unpleasant what happened with Haru, not only because I consider him a friend of mine, but also because of that great mind of his!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|He was always coming up with inventions and such; we had a really good deal: all the products he showed me how to make, I put up in my shop and we split the earnings: fifty-fifty!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|I've even put aside what he'd be making... you know, if he ever comes back.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Whatever would a bright and unassuming fellow be doing with a barbarian like Logan, anyway? I say there must be blackmail involved! Haru would never turn against us on a dime like this.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Well, friend, now that you know how to make the stuff, eh... care to... not spread it around too much?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Did you see Logan the night of the Temple incident?
|That night? When Logan attacked the Temple?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|I'm afraid I didn't see anything. I was just at home going through my inventory. I found out about all the commotion later, just like everyone else.}}
