{{dialogue|Elsie|Howdy, ''Player''! Didja get Mi-an's letter? Nevermind, it's a bit of a chore; here, check out these puppies! All the photos from yesterday!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Yep, I'd probably steer clear of that mail box of yours for today, but even if you didn't, and someone did write you a letter telling you to hold up on the investigation, you'd ignore it, wouldn't ya, 'cause we made a promise to get to the bottom of all this, didn't we!?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to take these here photographs to the folk we talked about yesterday and find out what all they know!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I'd take care of it m'self, but, to be honest, I can't rightly stand listenin' to half the folk around here for more than about a minute and a half, so the responsibility therefore lands squarely on you and your lonesome!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|With all this here evidence and what not, everybody'll have no choice but to spill the beans about what they know! 'Least, I assume that's how it works. So, you ready?}}

*''Yeah, I'm on it.''
*''Nah, won't we get caught?''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I'm on it.
|Yeehaw! Knew I could count on you! Once we clear Logan's name, we'll be heroes! Maybe they'll hold a parade for us- But let's not get too far ahead of ourselves!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|I gotta get back to the ranch before my Pa notices there ain't nobody keepin' the Yakmel company. Let's meet up at the {{textcolor|green|Blue Moon}} once you've got the scoop!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Nah, won't we get caught?
|Ah hah, so Mi-an has gotten to you hasn't she? Look, I'll tell you what I told her; first and foremost: don't be a weenie! Second, if you get caught, just tell 'em it was me who took them photographs, I'll take the fall; I don't give a whoop!}}
