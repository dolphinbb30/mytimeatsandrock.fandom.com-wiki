If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Burgess|On behalf of the Church of the Light, I thank you and Mi-an for your dedication to Telesis!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Everything you two did looks great, and I might add that my strolls around the oasis are much more pleasant now; the spruced up old barrier looks so... fence-y! Fence-y...? Fancy? No? Mi-an laughed at that...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Well, thanks, again. Gotta go!}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|I heard it was you and Ms. Mi-an who fixed all those holes on our platform! You know, it was getting to be a real safety hazard; some of the passengers were stepping off and tripping over the holes...}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|I was going to commission something but you know how it is: train life, am I right? Anyway, you guys did a great job, thanks so much!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|I heard it was you and Mi-an who teamed up to go fixin' things all around town, all of your own volition, and I must say, I am darn impressed!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|What you've done really embodies the spirit of Telesis; I think I speak for everyone when I say that I look forward to seein' y'all grow and prosper within our humble town.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Hey, there, sugar. Those new benches in town square, that was you and Mi-an? It's so nice to have a place to stop when I'm out running errands, I didn't even know what I was missin'! Y'all two keep up the good work, now!}}
