{{dialogue|Ged|We are a poor people. Although we are no longer at the mercy of that dastardly Rat Queen, our economic situation is dire.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|My beautiful Mayor, perhaps you can find it in your heart to help your subterranean comrades. And not for nothing, no! Our paws are your paws!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Of course we can help, but what can we do for you?}}
{{dialogue|Ged|I hear you are having problems with plants? We can dig them all up, very cheap.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Uh... let's put a pin in that.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|No? Right. I hate that idea, too. Are you accepting applications at the Whac-a-mole machine? My friends and I have exceptionally hard heads, and might I also add, you don't have real moles working there...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Interesting observation... Say, you're in the mountains, do you ever find anything useful there?}}
{{dialogue|Ged|Alas I do not know. Despite our endless digging, I can say the mountains are bare, save for an abundance of relics, ores, rare metals, sometimes gems...}}
{{dialogue|Ged|Indeed, it is obvious we have nothing we could provide for you.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Y'know Ged, I'm sure we could somehow find a use for some of those things...}}
{{dialogue|Ged|Mon Dieu! Mayor, you are as sharp as you are beautiful, magnificent! I can see why the people of Sandrock worship you.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Is he... being sarcastic?}}

*''No, he's just like this.''
*''I don't really know...''

{{dialogue|Ged|I would never be sarcastic. Look at my face. Zis is my serious face.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well if that's the case, we can certainly come to some sort of arrangement.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|Arrangement? Mayor, I must tell you, Princess Lumi already has my heart. Although you are a magnifique woman, this is an important decision, one I cannot take so lightly...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ahem. About the mine.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|O-oh, but of course.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Perhaps we could arrange a trade? Sandrock relies on ores and relics for its development, so if we work together we can get a flow going through, with of course, us paying you for your efforts.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|That seems like an acceptable situation. As they say, moles love Gols! What would you have us do? How would we begin this, as you say, trade?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, what do you need to get your ores and relics to town?}}
{{dialogue|Ged|Now that I think about it, it is hard for us to bring the ore to the surface from the depth of the mines... if we only had a Mine Cart that could work on the leftover rail systems already in the caves...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I'm sure ''Player'' could build one! I guess once we have a Mine Cart, and we'd be able to send some of Heidi's construction crew down to rebuild some of that rail system.}}

*''No problem!''
*''I've got a lot on my plate...''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=No problem!
|Great! Well, I'll discuss this with Heidi, and send you a diagram.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|indent=true|Fantastique! I will dig on over and tell the moles the good news. We will be seeing brighter days soon.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=I've got a lot on my plate...
|Ah... I guess I can send it to the Commerce Guild... Sorry, it'll probably take a bit longer.}}
{{dialogue|Ged|indent=true|I guess we can wait. I will tell the moles that they will have to fast for a few more days... Ah, but alas, our cake has been all but consumed...}}
