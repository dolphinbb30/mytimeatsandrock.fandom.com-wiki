{{dialogue|Logan|Hey there, beautiful. I was just talkin' some sense into our culinarily impaired nephew here...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Listen, kid. Best way to do something you don't wanna do is to just get it done. Get it over with. Longer you sit and pout, the longer you gotta deal with it. So just do it already.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Fine! But y'all gotta do it with me! Back at the hideout! And if anyone asks, I'm a hostage.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Works for me. So long as you like your cakes extra crispy.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Ugh! This is a disaster in the making... Maybe Grandma Vivi knows somethin'... bet Jazz'd let me cheat off her if I play my cards right... Say! ''Player''! What do you know about confectionaries!?}}

*''With me on the team, you can't lose.''
*''I don't have time for this right now...''
*''I'm a worse cook than Logan.''

{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|answer=With me on the team, you can't lose.
|Alriiiight! Thanks, ''Player''! I feel better about this already.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Sounds to me like we've got a plan, then. Let's swing by the old hideout tomorrow afternoon; in the meantime I'll run to the store and get us cake stuff: eggs, flour... hm... trail dust, I reckon...?}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|Ugh! Don't go to the store without me, alright? See you tomorrow, ''Player''! Leave this lunkhead to me!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=I don't have time for this right now...
|Yeah, don't you worry about it, darlin'. Too many cooks in the kitchen would spoil the cake, I reckon.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|Don't do this to me, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Come now, Andy. We've toppled armies; how hard could this be? We'll just follow our intuition. Surely, the key ingredient in any good cake is... hm... grit!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|''Player''! Don't leaaaave meeeee!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|That's impossible! Logan's done more harm as a chef than he ever did as a bandit!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|C'mon, y'all... I'm right here...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|You gotta help out, ''Player''. You'll figure it out. You always do! I'll fail for sure if you leave me with this oaf!}}
