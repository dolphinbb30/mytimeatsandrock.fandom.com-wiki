{{dialogue|Justice|''Player'', I hope I can once again count on you to come through as our town's most reliable Builder... And fix us up {{textcolor|green|one more hat}}...?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Oh, that's right! We even got a new design in. You know the hat business; feels like every time you get a new one it's obsolete in a few months...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah, here you go! A recipe for a Super Deluxe Deputy Hat with built in plating for extra protection. For the most extreme of combat situations...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Ceremony? Oh. Shoot. Uhhh... see if Unsuur brings it up. Like I said, this whole deputy, sheriff thing: it's all just something I made up! I mean, come on, I made the cat deputy, heh heh...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I thought everyone would get a kick out of that, but a couple people got kinda mad...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Anyway, Unsuur takes it real serious... But yeah, it's not really a thing.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Just take the Super Deluxe Deputy Hat to Unsuur when it's ready, he'll be over the moon...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|The deputy star has been polished to a mirror sheen. The sides have been reinforced. The brim and roll have been calibrated to a perfectly aerodynamic angle; it glides through the air like a shark in hot pursuit.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|The buckle set is original, too. The base of the crown has been filed down to make less of a target. Not only that, every part of this hat has been expertly crafted and customized...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Thanks, ''Player''. I love it.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Well. Now... I guess I've accomplished everything I ever hoped to in my life. That's cool.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Thanks for always being there when we're doing Civil Corps stuff. I think some of the skills I learned watching you are part of what got me this far.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|So... in a way... this is your Deputy Hat, too...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|But, I mean, you could just crank out like fifty more if you wanted so maybe you'd better just make one for yourself, I don't think we need to share.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Unless you want to. I'm cool either way.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Well, ''Player''... I guess... I guess I'd better get out on patrol. I have to live up to the hype.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Let's do stuff soon. See ya.}}
