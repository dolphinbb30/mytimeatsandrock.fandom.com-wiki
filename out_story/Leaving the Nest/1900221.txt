{{dialogue|Cooper|...Don't get me started on this infernal weather of ours! Ranchin' ain't like your doctorin', I gots to rely on the skies for sustenance. Everyday there's some emergency; just gotta hope for the best!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Not that I'd want it any other way, mind ye! Nothin' like a bit of hardship to put hair on yer chest!}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Bad weather... affects the body...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Ain't that just the truth. When you get sick, work becomes a real problem. In the sandstorms, gotta keep un-blinded, in the hot days, gotta keep un-burnt! This town of ours'll chew you up and spit you out if you let it!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Usually you know by the mornin'. If you got some illness, you know it's gonna take a few days to clear up. Them Yakmel, though, they still gots to be fed, cleaned, milked, and rallied even if I'm sicker'en heck.}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Special medicine... I can help you.}}
{{dialogue|Fang|''Player'', hello. Giving some medicine... to the Milkman...}}

*''Give some to Cooper.''
*''Sell some to Cooper.''
*''This medicine will be useless...''

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=Give some to Cooper.
|reward={{NPC2|Fang|rp=3}}|What? You got some special sauce for this ol' Yakboy? It'll make me feel back to my silent stoic self after eatin'? For free?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|indent=true|Yes. Here, for you. Very effective.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Well I do appreciate this doc, but I ain't the kind to be takin' without givin'! Tell ya what, I'll send on over a box of my finest Yakmel Milk first thing tomorrow, call it a trade, whaddya say?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|indent=true|The Yakmel Milk... I think... I'd like that.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Hey, if you've taken a likin' to my private reserve, then you're good in my books!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=Sell some to Cooper.
|reward={{NPC2|Fang|rp=1}}|You got some medicine that'll kick me into shape? Let me buy it off you, doc'! I ain't in the habit of takin'.}}
{{dialogue|Fang|indent=true|OK, that's fine.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Tell ya what, doc', if it works, I can make an order for every month. I can give ya the publicity, I'm sorta a famous picker 'round these parts. Folks listen to what this ol' Yakboy gotta say.}}
{{dialogue|Fang|indent=true|Right. Thank you.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=This medicine will be useless...
|''Player'', you done tried it already? Wait a minute... this ain't one of them, reverse psycho-mo-logical things is it? Well I ain't takin' no for an answer, young'un. Whether it's good or not, I gotta try, dagnabit!}}
{{dialogue|Fang|indent=true|Hm. Here you are.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Thanks, doc!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Fang sure earns his way in this town, eh? No wonder we got folks from all over travelin' to our little slice of sand! You know I always say, if it shines it might jus' be gold, but the smell of wine, ain't no better...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|But I digress. Seein' our doc just makes me ramble on. Don't be surprised, you know he's a pretty good listener!}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Helping others... is good.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Well, now that I got the both of ya, I feel oddly compelled to bring up the time I almost became a pilot over in Walnut Groove, despite not having ever flown a plane. Yes, I was playin' the night club circuit at the time..}}
{{dialogue|Fang|I think I see a tourist feeding a Yakmel over there.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Again!? How many times do I have to teach them cityslickers- Hold that thought, folks.}}
