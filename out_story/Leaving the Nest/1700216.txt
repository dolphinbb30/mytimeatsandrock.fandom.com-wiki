Title: The Eagle in the Valley
I wanted to like this book, I really did. It came highly recommended by a friend of mine, but I just couldn't get into it. Ultimately, I can't get around the fact that I just completely reject the premise. Like, are we really supposed to believe that all these animals don't know what an eagle is? And they have such arbitrary measures for what constitutes their own identity, like, obviously the eagle is not a spider, the spider should know that being a spider is defined by far more than just the number of legs one has, the spider should know that the eagle is an eagle the instant it lays its many eyes on that eagle! 

And the ending! What happens to the eagle after he gets out of the valley? Were the 'creatures with wings' he saw eagles? Other birds? His parents? I just don't feel like we get a good sense of resolution by the end of the story and are kind of left with more questions than answers. Also, they made the squirrels the bad guys? What the heck?! Huge blunder. Squirrels are cute, dummy!!!

Also how does the eagle know how to talk and say things like 'sir' when he was born literally five seconds ago. Ugh. I'm over this. Super over this.

2/10

Pictures were neat.
