Meeting Mint - I first met Mint when his life was in danger; he had fallen asleep near the train tracks and then rolled into harm's way. Luckily we were able to help him in time. It was only later that we learned that this wasn't the first time the sleeping habit of his had gotten him into trouble.

{{dialogue|Mint|indent=true|Where can I find City Hall? I'm supposed to talk with Mayor Trudy.}}
{{dialogue|Mint|indent=true|answer=Why were you sleeping on the tracks?
|Well, I don't know how to answer that one. Is it better or worse if I mention... this stuff happens from time to time? In any case, thanks for saving me!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|What if we hadn't showed up? You'd be in the hospital right now... at best!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Next time you feel like takin' a nap, check your surroundings! Ask yourself questions like: "Am I near any heavy machinery? Am I in a den of monsters? Do I smell gas?" This line of thinkin' may save your life one day, 'cause we're not always gonna be there, you got it?}}
{{dialogue|Mint|Er, I'm sorry, sir. I'll try to be more careful from now on.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah. You do that.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|All's well that ends well, I guess. Eh, hey, Builder: me and Unsuur've gotta patrol, can you do me a solid and take the Inspector here to City Hall? I'd feel a lot better if you went along, considering the circumstances...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Thanks, ''Player''. Unsuur, let's ride.}}
