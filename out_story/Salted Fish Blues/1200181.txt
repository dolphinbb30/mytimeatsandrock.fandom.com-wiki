{{dialogue|Vivi|Well hey there, Builder. I hope you've been liking our little community. Doing okay lately?}}

*''Yeah, I like it here!''
*''Not really...''
*''I... miss home.''

{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I like it here!
|Well that's just lovely to hear. I know it can be a tough place, but I'm glad you can see the good in the people here. Even if we can be a little... rough 'round the edges.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=Not really...
|That's a shame. I hope you can get the hang of it soon... Sometimes the folks here can take a little while to warm to newcomers. Give 'em time.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=I... miss home.
|I understand that. Bein' away from home has a strong effect on anyone. You did a brave thing coming over to Sandrock, and we all appreciate it.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Anyway, have you met Mort? He's been in Sandrock as long as anyone, lives down in the graveyard, watching over the lost. We all love him, but he makes a habit of asking for nothing, even if he needs it.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|I usually bring him some snacks and food to keep him going, but my hands are full at the moment. You mind giving an old gal a hand?}}

*''Of course!''
*''I've got a lot on my plate...''

{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=Of course!
|That's mighty kind of you. Now, Mort loves Salted Fish, but to make 'em, you'll be needing a {{textcolor|green|Drying Rack}}. I usually use mine but, with Jasmine living with us, four folks in a house makes for a lot of washing.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|Once you have yourself a Drying Rack, just add a little salt to a Sand Carp, an' set it out to dry for a bit. Here, take a bit of salt to get you going, I'm afraid you'll have to catch the fish yourself, though.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|Thanks again for helping out, Mort doesn't get out much, and I know he doesn't like people fussing over him, but he needs a helping hand. He'll appreciate it.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=I've got a lot on my plate...
|That's fine, I'm sure you're busy. Just let me know if you get the time...}}
