{{dialogue|Mort|Hehe, I didn't expect a young'un like you to have such patience to spend time with an old man like me, with one foot in the grave. Sandrock is a town plagued by disaster. When you came, a small glimmer of hope returned to me...}}

*''I'm confident I can help rebuild Sandrock.''
*''Why did you stay in Sandrock?''

{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|answer=I'm confident I can help rebuild Sandrock.
|Well, you young folks are filled with such a bright optimism, you keep moving forward, and never look back. Ha, I remember when I used to have that energy, back in my day...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|Sandrock has been through a lot to get here today, and a lot of people fought tooth and nail for this town. But I am worried that all this work could be for naught...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|answer=Why did you stay in Sandrock?
|When we arrived in Sandrock, we were so bright-eyed. I truly believed that we could maintain a balance between development and the environment and develop a good life here. But alas, the world doesn't conform to the whims of mortals...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|After the decline of Sandrock, I was torn. Maybe I should have persuaded Martle to leave this place. Maybe now we'd be living together, with a calm life somewhere else in the Free Cities. Was our persistence meaningful?}}
{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|But if I leave now, the efforts of the generations now buried will have been sacrificed for naught. This is not the world that Martle and I aimed to see... so I must stay.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Anyway, Martle and I have fond feelings about you Builders. When Sandrock was developing, we recruited a host of Builders. They were hardworking and brave, to a person.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|They built the Shonash Canyon Bridge, built the Moisture Farm, and everything else you see around you now... But it came at a cost. The effect this had on our environment was devastating.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|I hope you and Mi-an can keep in mind, that the environment is the foundation of sustainable development. But perhaps my words are coming too late...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Well, I've talked for too long, ''Player''. I won't hold you from your work any longer. Thank you for taking time to talk to an old man. You've warmed an aging heart.}}
The conversation ends.
