{{dialogue|Qi|''Player'', you're here. Good. I need you to help me build something. City Hall told me I couldn't hire you as my assistant anymore. Something about "conflict of interest." So I will be requiring your services as a Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Can you guess what it is?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The period allotted for guessing has expired. Sand Tea! Aha! But this is no ordinary Sand Tea.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I have designed a device which can effectively extract camellia sinesis into any liquid without dilution. Suffice to say this is a groundbreaking discovery for productivity.}}

*''Strong tea. Got it.''
*''Camallia... wha?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Strong tea. Got it.
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=1}}|Precisely. As you are well aware, my work involves a lot of concentration and mental fortitude.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Camallia... wha?
|Sigh. It makes tea. Strong tea. Strong tea that helps me concentrate.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|On a regular day, I start with three cups in the morning, and three more in the afternoon. Based on the caffeine release speed and duration, this seems to be the most effective. Skipping but one cup would cause my concentration to falter.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Unfortunately, with my current workload. I'd need several cups if I need to stay alert. The consequence would be a higher intake of water, which ends up as bathroom visits... and I have done the calculations. Many wasted hours.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Anyway. If you could build me an Express Tea Maker that can extract "Octuple Energy Tea", all of my woes would be solved. I've got the diagrams ready for you in advance.}}

*''I can help you.''
*''Too much on my plate right now...''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I can help you.
|Thank you. When will it be ready? It is imperative that it is completed as soon as possible.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Here is a cup of Sandtea to try for yourself. I am sure you will understand the urgency of this once you try.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Too much on my plate right now...
|Huh? Is there something the matter? You don't usually say "no" to my diagrams. Is there another researcher in your life?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Ahem. Well, if you could make the time to help, I would appreciate it.}}
