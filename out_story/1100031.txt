{{dialogue|Amirah|Trudy has a good heart. She shies away from the spotlight, but I see that as a good thing. Those who do not seek power are often best suited to wield it...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|How do you guys choose the Mayor anyway? I wasn't around when Trudy was made mayor... If I'm being honest, I've quite liked Matilda's leadership lately. Trudy's fine and good but... I didn't vote for her!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|With Trudy back, now I'll have two older women bossing me around! There's never been a better time to be a toadie, ''Player''! You heard it here first!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Trudy's a welcome readdition to the crew here. Between Heidi, Trudy, and Matilda with all their organizational skills, I think we can look forward to some big projects coming to Sandrock soon.}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|You know why Trudy, our Mayor, went out into the desert, don'tcha? Cuz no one else would! In case you ain't noticed, we got a little leadership problem on our hands. Had it been Matilda runnin' the same show, she'd have sent that little survey boy out there to do the dirty work. 'Course... he'd have died. But that's beside the point! We need do-ers, not thumb-twiddlers!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Trudy being back is great news for me! This means Matilda has more time to work with us church people again. Maybe she'll finally see all the hard work I've been doing. Notice me, Minister!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I'm fine with Trudy takin' back the reigns around here. So long as City Hall stay in their lane and don't try to tell me an' my family what to do!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Ah, so that little girl, her mother really is... You know, when she told me her mother was "in the desert," I thought that was a euphemism for, well... I suppose I need to get used to how literal these Sandrockers tend to be.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Such a seamless transfer of power between the Minister and the old Mayor. You'd never see something like that happen in Atara. Then again, there aren't exactly a lot of kickbacks that come with being on top around here...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Why've I got this big smile on my face? Well, my best friend just made it back from the desert! Not exactly an everyday ordeal! Which is a good thing, too, in and of itself...}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|You just gotta admire Trudy and her tenacity. It takes guts to go out into the desert by yourself, but that's just what she does, time and time again. Lotta folk would just send out their subordinates, but Trudy leads by example.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|My Ma's back! I'm so happy!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|After being stonewalled by Matilda at every turn, it's finally time for me to pitch my idea to our openminded Mayor Trudy! I call it, the "More Trains Initiative!" It's a plan to commission more trains, so that more people can be ferried here.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Glad Trudy's back! Matilda had us fill out a report every time we fired our gun on duty, can you believe that? For how long have I been denied my cop-given right to fire into the air in celebration, frustration, and... possibly just to stress a point?}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Finally, Mayor's back in town! Maybe now we'll finally get some order in this bedlam! Er... Wait, what am I sayin? Things were goin' great with Matilda in charge...}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Sure is hard for me to understand how Trudy keeps puttin' herself in danger out there in the desert despite there not bein' any real evidence that what she's lookin' for is really out there! ...Well, I s'pose it ain't none of my business. See you at Church!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Trudy just needs a while to get back in the swing of things! When times are tough, well, there's no tougher time to be in charge. Light knows I've learned that the hard way...}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Wow, Mayor Trudy really went out into the desert for that long, all on her own, just 'cause she thought there was a chance she could make a difference! That's dedication for you. Let's work hard to back her up, ''Player''; she believes in this town!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Our Minister always has to compensate for our Mayor's shortcomings. As problems surmount in Sandrock, it's been painful to see Matilda being spread thinner and thinner. I pray I am misguided, but I must admit I do worry for our future...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|It's good to have Trudy back. I am always careful to see her off on each of these journeys she so frequently goes on, as it's never certain it won't be her last...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Somethin' about Sandrock breeds a real hard-headed folk. Any idea how many times Trudy's been out into the desert lookin' for who-knows-what? Me neither, I've lost count...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|So Trudy's back. What the heck was she doing out in the Eufaula, anyway? So many better places to be. Though, I do have to admit, her hair-do is amazingly intact...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Oho! Our fearless leader has returned! With Trudy at the helm, there's no limit to what we Sandrockers can do! With her milquetoast physique and unique powers of indecisiveness we can- Puahah! Ahaha! Ah... Oh, I told myself I wasn't going to make fun... Rude, Pen! Very rude! You heard nothing, Skinny.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Trudy's expedition into the desert has once again proven to be unfruitful. Unsurprising. "Hope" is not a viable substitute for data.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Finally, Trudy's back. She owes me a Taco. I love Tacos. Sure, I could make my own Taco, but what's a sweeter flavor enhancement than something that's owed?}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|I'm glad Trudy's back. Gonna try to get some tax breaks for me an' the boys. Trudy's way easier to push around compared to Matilda!}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Ahah... I guess all my time in the desert has left me a bit rusty when it comes to public speaking. Well, that's me! I get by with a little help from my friends.}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|A lot of times, I don't even notice Mayor Trudy. She never tries to stand out, just like me.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|It's so lovely having my friend Trudy back in town! Now, don't get me wrong, I love chattin' with you young'ns, but it's nice to have someone around closer to my own age. She's the only one around here who appreciates a good conversation on subjects like digestion and strange aches.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|With the Mayor back, I expect to see you and, er... the annoying one, uh... Mi-an, mm, that's it. Yeah, you two best straighten up and fly right! All this hammer waggling you two've been passing off as "building's" not gonna cut it anymore that the big cheese is back in town, got it? Step it up!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Um. I don't really know how to make it "cool" for everyone. But Trudy's data's all new, I really might be able to get something out of them...}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|If Trudy's plan comes to fruition, it'd be a dream come true for Arvio and I. How we've longed to live in a place where each day isn't its own struggle...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Wow, if they started planting trees in Sandrock, we wouldn't hardly need that umbrella I commissioned anymore! But that's okay, I'd just pivot to swings!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Give me a T! Give me an R! Give me an E! What's that spell? Tre-...! Oops, wait, let me try that again...}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Hey, it's a long shot, but you know what happens if this place goes green? Real estate values are goin' through the roof! My Game Center'll be worth fifty times what I paid for it! I'm rootin' for Trudy!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Plants grow in dirt. Ain't growin' no plants in no sand. Why I always gotta be the voice of reason around here, huh? I got too much ranch work to be messin' around and solvin' all y'all's conundrums every which way. I mean, shoot, I'd run for mayor, but I don't trust onone of y'all to take care of m'Yakmel while in office what with y'all continuin' to display a complete lack of common know-howity!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Wow, a Sandrock with trees? My Ri-ri will be so excited if he has new materials to work with! Let's do everything we can to make Trudy's dream come true!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|My Pa says that trees ain't gonna grow in sand. Somehow that makes more sense to me than the Mayor's plan.}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|So the plan is to make Sandrock green and prosper to be bigger than Logan and his gang? Hm... I can't really use that kind of arc in my novel, but I wish you all the best!}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I for one am very interested to see the result of Zeke and Trudy's research. If their plan works, we're all going to be a part of history! Which, for me, almost certainly means... extra credit!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|I've been working on plans to build a road to Portia through the Southern Eufuala. See, right now, we import water the long way around through Atara. With a direct road we could save a fortune on logistics! Trudy and I are just hoping this tree stunt of hers will be enough to attract investors...}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|C'mon, nobody's listenin' to Heidi's plan? We gotta scrounge up cash like we did for the bridge and build a road towards Portia! Even if their whatever-it-is-crust works, we can't sustain a forest out here right now, not without water!}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|My Ma's the smartest! She's gonna make trees grow outta the sand. Even if it's impossible, my Ma can do it! Oh! How were the Shipwreck Ruins? Find any pirates? Arrrr!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Hm, I thought the Fireside was going to be about Heidi's idea to build a road to Portia. Where do I fit into all this greenery business?}}

{{dialogue|Justice|My Ma showed me an old photo of Sandrock when it was still covered by trees. I cannot imagine what it would be like if our town becomes like that again. Just wild!}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Yo! You're gonna be workin' with Trudy on all them trees and what not, eh? Speakin' of trees, don't forget your roots! You're too good in the mines to be waterin' daisies all day, y'hear?}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|If you go out there to plant trees with Trudy, do be wary of sunstroke. And... if them plants don't grow, well, it's all a part of the Light's plan...}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Trudy is a fine leader, she just lacks confidence. Folks can smell that; sometimes it won't matter what you have to say. I'm always happy to lend my voice to her cause, though, I'd be more comfortable knowin' she could fend for herself...}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|This is all so cool, ''Player''! I knew I wanted to make a difference when I came to Sandrock... who could've known we'd be doing something like turning the desert green, though?}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Trudy... Ugh. So many resources towards such a lost cause. How arrogant to think that we can defy nature itself? Oh, and don't think you're off the hook either, Builder. What you did with Mi-an was irresponsible...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|When you smash your head against a stone enough times, and you don't give up or die tryin', the stone will eventually break.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|With the green desert plan, the two guys I'm rootin' for the most are Zeke and Mort. Those two have spent their whole lives trying to make this happen, to the point where they've both become, well, not like they used to be. And Mort... hard to say how much the old-timer's got left in 'im...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Hey, ''Player''! Know anyone who wants to dye their hair green in honor of the new greenification plan? You know, for luck!}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Everyone's got the wrong idea about this whole greenification thing. Lotta short-sighted thinking. Not like the great Protector of Sandrock, who always thinks ahead! What'll be the best part about having shade, huh, Skinny? That's right, I can finally take off my shirt!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Zeke has been researching desert planting for upwards of twenty years. Just goes to show that scientific discovery isn't systematic. Sometimes, all you need is a spark of an idea. Science is beautiful.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|I've only worked with cactus wood my entire life... If we get trees in Sandrock... I mean, what if everything I've learned doesn't apply? I'll be useless!}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Trees growing in the desert? I mean, goes against conventional logic, but, eh... stranger things have happened, I guess.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I must admit, I'm worried about Logan and his gang trying to interfere with our plans but... we don't have any choice! We have to try to push to make Sandrock a better place and just face whatever he throws at us best we can.}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Green desert? Never say anything's impossible. But I've also heard, "never say never." So...}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I haven't seen such a spark in Trudy's eye since before her- Well... for a long time, let's say. She really seems to think that this time's it! I hope... she's right. For all our sakes.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|It's like I always say, Matilda is a genius! Coming up with that whole tree planting thing all by her lonesome. Where does she get her inspiration? ...Oh. Right. Religion. Ah, well. Maybe next life!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|I'm prepping myself for disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I'm gonna keep doing my best no matter what, it's just... We've been trying this for so long, I don't wanna get my hopes dashed. Again...}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|Trudy's not one to be bothered by Matilda being put on the front photo for our article, but... it still doesn't seem right to me...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Wow, our town's planting research has caught far away attention! You know what they say: "Any publicity is good publicity. Especially... good publicity!"}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Wow! Trudy and Zeke's tree plot seems to be really growing! I have no idea how any of it works, but I always believed in them anyway! Maybe blind optimism really is more than it's cracked up to be, eh?}}

{{dialogue|Catori|So Trudy just happened to bump into some Old World super algae that helped 'em push planting technology forward by centuries? When am I gonna have that kinda luck? ...Eh? It took 'em twenty years? Ah, well... still kinda lucky...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|I do believe Matilda is indeed the most deserving of credit for all what's been done with the trees and what not, but if we had to do a second place, I reckon only person who'd fit that bill'd be... me! Yeah, you heard right! When the chips were down and everyone else had thrown in the towel; only one man still stood in y'all's corner! ...No? Alright, how about this angle: uhh... My incessant contrarian bickerin' inspired y'all to go an' prove me wrong! C'mon, I just want credit for somethin'...}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|You know what's going on with the tree plot, right? This is big. Now I feel like there's no place to go but up for our town!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Why do we gotta fight the desert, anyhow? I like the desert! Well, if a new biome brings new critter friends... I reckon I'm on board. Tentatively!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|If I'm being honest, when it comes to the tree planting, my heart's not really in it. Of course, I'm very happy for Sandrock, but, I just... I'm more interested in working on my novel, you know?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Hah. With this photoshoot coming up, it'll be the first time I've had my picture in the Atara Times; even after living there for so many years! ...Still think I'm going to stand towards the back, though.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Alright! Trudy's tree farm really is working! With this kind of exposure, I have a strong feeling we're going to be able to secure funding for our Portia idea soon. Then Sandrock is gonna be a powerhouse!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Matilda steals the show whenever there's a public event; that's the power of charisma. I don't mean to take away from all she's accomplished, but in my mind, the credit for planting development belongs to Trudy and Zeke.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Huh? We're making Matilda the face of our article? This proves it. Democracy simply doesn't work!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Wow, with the trees growing out in the desert, looks like Sandrock is finally... on the right track! Haha... I'm sorry, I won't make that joke again. ...Yes, I will.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|I'm all for this tree plantin' business, but I am a little worried about expanding our city limits like this. Me, Unsuur, and the Captain are already spread pretty thin as it is...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|So like, technology is bad because it caused the Age of Darkness, but... like... findin' old technology is gonna be what saves this town? How am I supposed to have an opinion when everything is so fricken contradictory!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Oh, I know Trudy and Zeke did most of the heavy liftin' when it comes to all that fancy science, but... well, if Sandrock is gonna get a whole mess of attention, I reckon I just feel more comfortable lettin' people know that we have a strong and able Minister!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|I must say, I'm flustered that the townfolk want me to appear in the article that represents all of our hard work; Trudy and Zeke most of all. But here in Sandrock, optics like that don't matter. We all know who to thank for this. That includes you, too!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Guh! We put our hides on the line for Zeke's research and that's the thanks we get? C'mon, where's the enthusiasm, people? This Bio-crust stuff is gonna work!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|To those naysayers who think Trudy ought to be the face of Sandrock's most recent development, I pose this rebuttal: what would've become of our town without Matilda's divine leadership in the absence of our so-called savior? Mmhmm.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Well, I'll be... darned... She's really doing it... And my boy... Never thought I'd live to see the day. Can't wait to tell Martle!}}

{{dialogue|Owen|When I first heard about Sandrock's anti-desert initiative, I was against it. That's, of course, because I misheard it as "anti-dessert." How can anyone be anti-dessert, I thought! Haha, I was so young then.}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Hm, that tree farm thing really worked. So I suppose it would be really tacky of me to go on vacation this week? Sigh. Alright, I'll honor you all with my presence on class picture day or whatever it is.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Obviously I'm not miffed about Matilda getting the spotlight for the latest turn of events. Why, I already have my place as Mr. Spring in this year's "Hunky Adventurers" calendar! You know, the one that gets published in Atara. It's nice to let others bask in the limelight a bit, eh?}}

{{dialogue|Qi|The true yield in Zeke's breakthrough is that, for once, a scientific achievement is receiving media interest. This bodes well for my research; once I find Olympia, well... Don't worry. I won't let the fame go to my head; I'll always be that down to earth researcher you all know and love.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Dan-dan is so excited about Trudy's tree thing; I've never seen her with this much energy, man. She's bouncin' off the walls at home... I kinda can't deal with it, man!}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Yo, they wanna do an article on Sandrock? They don't want me to weigh in on nothin' do they? Whew... got worried for a sec. I don't, like, got a opinion about... anything!}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Er, nobody really asked but: we're not trying to plant a whole forest. Not yet, anyway. But once the world sees what we've accomplished already, I'm confident it'll put Sandrock back on the right track! Well, somewhat confident...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Wow... appearing in a group photo for the Atara Times! Next to becoming a deputy, that's my other dream. Life is half complete.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Trudy's tree farming thing really worked out. Good for her! You know, she's really been needing a win, the way folks have been actin'. It's really not fair; people see our town dryin' up and look to the top for somebody to blame, but Trudy's one of the hardest workin' folk in Sandrock!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|You're probably wondering why you didn't get written up for risking your lives at those Shipwreck Ruins a while back. Ahem, yes, well, it slipped my mind! On an unrelated note, the Commerce Guild has huge life insurance policies in place for the two of you! So... Dive away! Dive to your heart's content! The greater the risk, the greater the reward, I always say!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|I know I said, "Nobody get their hopes up," but... This is kinda it. It hasn't even hit me that this is really happening yet...}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|I must say I'm alarmed to see what's happening in Sandrock. Sending a bounty hunter after one of their own. What do you think will happen when they catch him, I wonder?}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|What do angry mobs even need torches and pitchforks for anyhow? I mean, we have plenty of other weapons and light sources in Sandrock... In any case, it's not my place to question such things. I see a demand and I supply it!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|If Logan comes back again, I'm not gonna let him get past me! You know what they say: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice..." ... Fool me twice... You can't get fooled again.}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Great. Who's gonna want to come check out my Sandrunning slope after an old lady gets kidnapped in front of everyone, on camera! Eh... well... least you guys got her back...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Finally, we're gettin' a bounty hunter! See, ''Player''? Whoever yells the loudest, gets what they want. And that's how it should be! If you weren't heard, you didn't want it enough!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Gah! That's it! When you mess with the Minister, you mess with all of us! No more second chances from me, Logan! No more Mrs. Nice Dan-bi!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Ain't no bounty hunter gonna catch Logan...}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Logan's escape artistry really is amazing... Er! Sorry, I don't mean to be rooting for the bad guys, it's just... well, you have to admit, it's dramatic! Every time it seems like his back is against the wall, he finds a way to pull off the impossible at the last possible second!}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Pretty genius maneuver by Justice sticking that catnip to Logan's horse! Gotta admit, I'm impressed; he really makes the most of what he's got.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|It's not like Trudy caving to pressure and going through with something she doesn't want to, like with this bounty hunter thing. Wait, yes it is. We'll... work on that.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|This whole thing with Logan keeps escalating... And now I think he feels the noose tightening around his neck... Mark my words: he's going to try something desparate soon...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|I hate to see the Minister and the Pastor fighting.}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Well. It might not be the right thing to say, but... at least those bandits have stayed off my trains for a while! Erm. Sorry.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|I'm fine with the idea of bringin' some specialist out here. I ain't too big to deny help! If I'm being honest, this whole ordeal has really helped me understand my own weaknesses. I'm more of a 'fight the bad guys' kinda guy than a 'catch the bad guys' kinda guy.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I actually can't even remember the last time I caught anything. Well, there was that one time where I caught you fallin' off that train, heh, remember that? But, uh... yeah that's not the same thing, is it...?}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|It's a good thing Pebbles is too young to really understand how bad our cops are at catching that darn Logan; might give him the wrong idea about authority and stuff.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I always tell my Coop to stay out of conflicts. It's been bad for his blood pressure! And now... it surely appears we're going along with something they all came up with in the heat of the moment... I do hope clearer heads prevail...}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|I'm alright! Thanks for checking in. Wrists still a bit stiff, but I'll recover. Perhaps it's time I started spending a bit less time in the spotlight... To be leading the charge against... bandits! At my age? I trust Trudy, Miguel, and... people like you to take up the reigns and lead us towards the Light that surely awaits at the end of this long, dark tunnel!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|I'm not really feeling the same level of ire as a lot of people, although I did feel a bit swept up after seeing the mob. Graaah! Whoops. Had a little flashback!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Finally. For once, people in this town have decided to listen to reason. We should've raised the stakes appropriately the day after Logan attacked our Temple in the first place.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Logan searches for something that doesn't exist. With the proper conviction, such a pursuit will drive any to madness...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Yeah Logan got away again, but this time, we really made him sweat. Now he knows that we aren't always going to play right into his hand, so he'll be shook the next time he tries anything. Er, just a little something I picked up playing cards at the saloon all these years.}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Why kidnap Matilda of all people? Do they have any idea how long it takes to get her floof just right? Ugh. Grab the carpenter! His 'do is a two minute ordeal...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|If I just hadn't eaten those Duvos Peppers the day before... Hnghhh...! Ooh- There they are again... Hng... Aftershock...! Keep it together Pen ol' pal... Keep it together...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|I've seen the townsfolk struggling with this bandit issue for far too long, it's beginning to become a distraction. Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to solve the problem.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Ahem. Next time you see Logan, simply shout out, "e^(iπ) + 1 = 0!" The beauty of the formula will leave him dumbfounded, giving the lawmen plenty of time to detain him. Hm? You don't think he'll understand? Tell you what: if I'm wrong, I owe you a tea.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|The way I see it: catching bandits is like catching a butterfly. If you snatch at it, it'll just keep flying away. But if you just sit and wait... maybe... just maybe, it'll land on you. You can have that one for free, ''Player''.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Logan's really crazy, man. Grabbing Matilda like that? Seems like everything he does just shows more how he's gone off the deep end... maybe it's somethin' in the desert? Ya stay out there too long and you lose your mind...}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Um. Well. It might not be the best decision, but it's what we're doing. We're hiring a "specialist." Hopefully if nothing else, this'll keep folks from tryin' more extreme methods, and... who knows, maybe he really will be the one to track down Logan and his gang...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|We failed to protect the Minister. We will perform better next time. Because when you hit rock bottom, there's no place to go but... rock top.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|That Logan went from helpin' lil' ole ladies cross the street to kidnappin' 'em and ticklin' 'em with a feather! Never have I seen someone fall so far... what is the matter with that boy?}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Before our specialist arrives, I recommend that you beef up your handbook a bit; snag a few recipes from the Commerce Guild, things, you know, a specialist might need to track down those hoodlums. Eh? What might those be, you ask? I dunno, nunchucks? Booby traps? Look, I can't spoon feed you every little detail, some things you just have to learn on the job. Now go, go, go!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|They're really going through with the bounty hunter thing, huh? That worries me, ''Player''. People are startin' to get desparate...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|The bounty hunter seemed a little shifty to me, so I added a "bounty hunter" tax to all of my goods, just for him! Pretty smart, huh! ...Problem is, this guy doesn't seem to have much in the way of funding...}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Bronco the Kid looks tough! Wouldn't wanna mess with that guy! Luckily, I've managed to be so law-abiding that he hasn't bothered to give me the time of day!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|I hate to be a negative Nancy but... This bounty hunter? Really? This is the guy we got to track down the scourge of the Eufaula? I want the military! These half-committal measures we keep comin' up with ain't gonna cut it. I need stability to grow my business already, sheesh!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Back in my day we didn't need bounty hunters. When folks done wrong, they'd just turn themselves in, and that was that. Stole a grape from the market? They sent you to the farm to grow a new grape and replace it with the one what you took. Stole a bunch of money? We'd break into your house! Or send you to the farm... Lotta folks back then got sent to the farm! My Pa for example...}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I overheard the bounty hunter at the saloon complaining that he "hates vegetables." I know we're desparate for help, but can we really depend on someone with such a blackened heart to work for us?}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I feel some weird desire to team up with this bounty hunter fella... but... me? On the side of law and order? Ahh! What's goin' on in my head right now!?}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|The plot thickens! Will Bronco, the rugged and merciless bounty hunter, have what it takes to hunt down Logan and his devil-may-care band of ragtag ruffians? Find out next time in...! Well, I don't have a title yet...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Somethin' about that bounty hunter makes me nervous... If he's really as good as they're saying he is, with a baby face like that, he must have the skills to back it up!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|So it's really come to this... a bounty hunter. Logan, you are neck deep in it now, boy...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|That bounty hunter looks like a kid with a beard!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Did that bounty hunter ride into town? I never saw him get off any of my trains... Hm, that's peculiar! Well. None of my business! Have a good day, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Somehow I thought this specialist would treat the Corps with a little more respect than your run-of-the-mill agent types... Dunno why I did... sigh...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|I just wanna keep that bounty fella away from lil' Pebbles. Seems like a bad influence. ...Where could I put Pebbles to give 'im a role model when Rocky ain't around... Clinic? No. Research Center? No. City Hall? Ehhh... Oh! What about you, Builder? I'll talk it over with Rocky and get back to ya.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|That "specialist' fella seems like such a sweetheart! Am I off my rocker? Seems like everybody was sayin' he was gonna be bad to the bone but I just wanna go up and... pinch his cheek!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Um. Hello, ''Player''. Have you met Bronco the Kid yet? He's the specialist we hired to help track Logan. If he needs your help, I reckon... try your best to get him what he needs...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|...Bronco the Kid? Really? I specifically requested Bardock the Bloodstalker! He stalks people! He stalks their blood! What can we expect from a... "Kid!?"}}

{{dialogue|Mort|I'm sure I've seen that bounty hunter somewhere before... But... how could that be possible...? Did I know his father?}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Whew, that bounty hunter is a real taskmaster; puttin' me to work all day! Real stickler, too. Said he wanted a plain cheese pizza; I accidentally got one little mushroom slice on it and he sent the whole thing back! Guess that meticulous attention to detail is how he always gets his man...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Hey have you met the bounty hunter yet? Kinda weird for someone so young to wear a wig, am I right? Ooh, you're right, I shouldn't be gossiping about someone who just got here... I'll give it a few days.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Obviously, I didn't expect our specialist to be stronger than me, but... I certainly expected him to be stronger than you! Oh well. All he has to do is find that baleful bandit so I can brutalize him!}}

{{dialogue|Rian|I don't normally pay attention to... anything. But I noticed that dude Bronco has pretty much just kicked up his heels, sittin' around, doin' absolutely nothin' towards trackin' down any criminals. A man after my own heart.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Yo, this bounty hunter stays outta my business, then I got no beef with 'im. Somebody's gotta get this Logan guy, I don't really care who it is.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Ah, hello, ''Player''! Have you spoken with our specialist yet? He said he wanted your help with something personally! Let's, um... let's give him a chance, okay...?}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I dunno if you noticed, but the specialist meant to track down Logan is in town now.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I gotta find that Bronco fella's skincare routine; that boy doesn't look a day over twelve!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Things have gotten hectic with the Logan situation so... Think I'm just gonna spend extra time in the Moisture Farm til this whole thing blows over.}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|With the right make-up and outfit, almost anyone can look like a different person. The art of disguise has always been intriguing to me but... Oh, I'm sorry. That boy caused you a lot of trouble, didn't he? I'll... reserve such commentary...}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Well, Builder. You got me fair and square. And you know what they say: "Crime don't pay." Or maybe it's "crime do pay, but usually only in the short term." In my case though, I ain't really any richer or poorer for all what's transpired, so uh... "Sometimes with crime, you just break even." Anyway, no hard feelings, Builder.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|How is it that every gang has, like... each person has their own set of skills? Logan's the fighter, Haru's the inventor, Andy's the trickster... How come it's never just a bunch of guys who don't have any defining skills? Like... our Civil Corps for example! They're just two guys who kinda know how to fight and not much else. Oops. Was that mean...?}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Who says the bounty hunter and Andy couldn't be the same person?! Huh? Oh, we're all past this already? Um. Sorry. Everyone else is always solving mysteries; I just wanted to try my hand for once!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Disguised Andy had a pretty immature obsession with winning my prizes for... someone. Kept mumbling under his breath. Ah well, hindsight is twenty twenty...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Yeah, I knew that kid was fibbin'. 'Course, I didn't say nothin'. Thought everybody knew. Thought we was all just playin' along, like when one of them kids has their birthday and you let 'em pretend they're Peach all 'round town, that sorta thing. They let me do that after a Yakmel kicked me square in the noggin', best day of my adolescent life.}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I can't believe nobody discovered the true identity of the bounty hunter for so long! I hope someone at the Civil Corps gets fired for this blunder...! Although, then we'd just have one less Civil Corps member, huh? Gahh!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|That lil Andy? Aw he's kinda cute. 'Bout time Jasmine had a buddy around here. She's growin' into a bit of a smart alec...}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Wow. That boy who impersonated the bounty hunter is one of my fans. You don't suppose... my work somehow influenced his turn to a life of crime? No... no, that just couldn't be possible...}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I stay home for a couple of days and half the town gets bamboozled by a seven year old? Er, okay. Bold of me to say that I'd have been one of the only ones to see through his disguise but... Right. Right, I'm sorry.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|That boy fooled a lot of us... But what's more troubling: how did he know we had a bounty hunter coming? And... How did he know what our bounty hunter looked like...?}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|That boy actin' as a bounty hunter asked me for a bunch of equipment when he first got here. I'm just... glad I didn't have what he wanted in stock. Don't know if I could live with myself knowin' that my gear ended up hurtin' someone I care about...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Andy in disguise tried to give me a dolly. If I took it... Well, that's the closest I've ever been to getting cooties... Kind of a scary thought!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Andy in disguise asked me if he could drive the train. It's a good thing I refused; allowing him to do so would've been illegal! And incredibly dangerous! As I think about it, it's probably illegal because it's so incredibly dangerous!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Man... can't believe I let that kid get in here and give us the run-around like that so easily. Maybe this Logan case is really gettin' to me...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Knew there was somethin' off about that bounty hunter! I got a good nose for who my kids should and shouldn't be spendin' time around, and lemme tell ya, bandits are low on the list! Just below pirates and just above... jugglers...}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I can't believe that Logan would send a child in to do his dirty work. He sure ain't makin' a good case for himself these days, I tell you what...}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|I must admit, it's a bit perturbing to know that so many of us could be fooled by a child... We may need some sort of additional security measures. Stay safe, Builder.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|I tried to gather proof that that boy was actually not the bounty hunter he said he was...! But... well, too little too late. Guess I bit off more than I could chew this time. Say! Speaking of which, want some jerky? Help yourself, as usual!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Absolute incompetence. If I hadn't been blind with rage over Trudy hiring the wrong bounty hunter, perhaps I might've had the presence of mind to crack through that insolent child's paltry facade! Grr... No matter. I will teach him the way...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|That boy... what a tangled web to weave, learning so young to deceive...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|In retrospect, it all seems so obvious... the bounty hunter who requested that I have candy and comic books delivered up to his room was actually a child impersonating said bounty hunter... Well, this is why I leave the detective work to you all!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|I knew there was something sussy about that little bandit boy with the wig... I mean, obviously I spotted the wig instantly. Thought it was a bit strange that someone so young would wear one but... Ugh! I'm just too non-judgemental to catch criminals! Except when it comes to clothing. And taste.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|That kid in Logan's gang asked me about my weaknesses... I feel so... violated! Do you think they're plotting something against me directly? But... but... everyone loves me...!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|There's an obvious solution to dealing with imposters coming to Sandrock. We just need to get everyone's fingerprints on file and we'll never have such an occurrence again. ...If you're not guilty, ''Player'', you have nothing to hide.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|My dude... I gotta warn you, Dan-dan's not too happy about the way things panned out with that imposter dude... She said she's thinking about moving us out of Sandrock cuz everyone's, like... dumb. So, uh... yeah, get the word out: smarten up.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Youse all got flim-flammed by that bounty huntin' kid? Ah, I get bamboozled all the time, you get used to it. Don't get mad, get even! ...Oh, he's like ten years old? Yeah, I dunno, whaddya comin' to me for advice for? All I do is smash stuff!}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I've received a lot of criticism for my handling of the faux bounty hunter situation and... well, what can I say? It's warranted. I even saw a picture of the guy before I hired him and... well, Andy's disguise was pretty believable! In my opinion at least... Sigh...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|...Andy threw those marbles, and said "Eat marbles, marble eaters," and then one flew up into my mouth. The prophecy... it came true...}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I believe we're doing the right thing by taking in Andy the bandit boy. It's said that the child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down just to feel its warmth... Let's... not get burned down, hm?}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Huh? Yeah, I gave that stupid weiner kid his stupid weiner shield, who cares? He promised me vast riches! That could happen to anybody. Just... get back to work!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Hm. Guess the bandits needed something made by Builders. Pretty sure it's just you guys 'round these parts. Wait... what about that Wang Jr. guy? Where does he live...?}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|No respect for anyone's property, that man... The bounty hunter invaded my studio; he nearly broke several of my ceramics rummaging around looking for "clues." If he bothers you, ''Player'', just be stern. That's my advice...}}

{{dialogue|Andy|I tend to enjoy outsmartin' law types, but that Bronco feller... It ain't even fun gettin' the better of that guy. Hey ''Player'', when are you gonna try to catch me again, huh? Oh, don't worry, I'll think of somethin' that'll get you hoppin' mad...!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Heh heh... this time, my "bounty hunter tax" worked like a charm! Let me take you out to lunch sometime, ''Player'', City Hall's footing the bill!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|I for one love our new specialist! When he asks me personal questions for hours on end, it really makes me feel really special, just as advertised!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Bronco the Kid accused my games of being rigged! And... well, to a certain extent, they are. But anyone can win if they just put in the time! Harumph!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Look. You ain't done nothin' wrong, you ain't got nothin' to worry about. Fella gotta take my horses out for what they think is a joyride, then grill 'em on the facts? Fine in my book. I couldn't live with myself if I found out my horses were makin' back room deals, sellin' black market hay, and... who knows what!?}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|This new bounty hunter is even worse than the old one! The old one was useless, the new one is... negative useful! Worse!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I dunno if this bounty fella is the real deal... I asked him to spar with me and he started perspirin' somethin fierce! Heh heh... I mean, I know I'm pretty tough, but... I never met a lawman who was afeared of me!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Characters like Bronco the Kid you can't make up... I wonder if I'll be criticized if I include his likeness in the novel I'm working on...? Is he too unbelievable?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Somehow with this compromise to hire a discount bounty hunter, we've managed to please precisely no one. Thaaat's politics!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey, ''Player''! Eh... sorry, just a little frazzled. Had to spend far too long explaining to that Bronco guy how each of my blueprints is definitely not a death ray or death ray related...}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|I am struggling to find any redeemable qualities with this bounty hunter who just rolled into town. Guy keeps asking me for discounts. Like... come on, man; City Hall will pay for anything you need, why're you trying to reach into my pocket?}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Mr. Bronco the Kid thinks I did something wrong. I'm the real kid, what could I do? Maybe I better do something, prove him right! Gr... I hate being wrongfully accused of stuff!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I've heard even on the ride over, Mr. Bronco was harassing people in the dining car, accusing them of being on Logan's payroll! I had to deal with some angry customers.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Normally, I never had any trouble takin' orders. Y'know, I haven't really been sheriff all that long. But man... This Bronco guy. I just have a lot of trouble seein' his reasoning most of the time... I had to explain the irony of literally going on a 'wild Yakmel chase...' and he didn't get it...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|The bounty hunter went into our miner's dorms and searched through all their personal items! He didn't find nothin' incriminatin', but... he did find something under Peck's bed that'll never let me look at him the same way again...}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Mr. Bronco the Kid came by and tested my Sandrolls for poison by... eating all of them. But joke's on him, they were poisoned! With cholesterol! Foolin' aside, ''Player'', do enjoy sweets responsibly!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|If anything about this whole bounty hunting ordeal is discouraging to you, ''Player'', well... you're not alone. But it is always darkest before dawn. City Hall and I will find a way to sort all this out and restore safety, as well as comfort to the people of Sandrock.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|The bounty hunter seems to have really taken a liking to you, ''Player''. You're kinda lucky, oh... By the way, if he lets you see that Feng Shui thingie let me know... it seems cool.}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Our specialist has insisted on even investigating the Church and City Hall... Yes, brilliant. What a twist it would be to hire someone to convict us of our own crimes. Ugh... Imbecile...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Whipped up into a state of fear, we've allowed this man to enter our homes and disrupt our privacy, all in the name of "law and order..."}}

{{dialogue|Owen|That bounty hunter guy came in and wanted to get everyone's fingerprints to put on file... Seems kinda extreme, but he kept sayin' "if you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide." I... guess that makes sense?}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|When that brutish bounty hunter was ransacking my humble abode looking for "clues," I stealthily sprayed him with some cologne to cover up that... musk of his. Tragically, his personal pheromones overpowered my Preedo and turned it to the dark side... Now he smells like a martini with a gym sock in it.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Our new bounty hunter guy came into my room and started "investigating" me! So I put him in a headlock! Didn't let him go for an hour, hahaha. Good times, good times...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|The person seeking Logan came into my lab uninvited and got his grubby fingers all over my equipment. I will never forgive him for this.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Dan-dan really likes to argue with the new specialist in town. Everytime she does, I worry for our safety, but at the same time, seeing her snap back so fearlessly... it's kinda hot.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Bounty hunter says to me, "I wanna check for clues in the mines." I says, "There's too many mines, it'll take forever." Guy says, "Sounds like you're hidin' somethin'." I says, "You callin' me a liar!?" Then everything went black, and I woke up in the Blue Moon, with five empty plates in front of me... Did I eat all that spaghetti!?}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Er, yes, I'm aware that the situation right now is not quite... ideal. Let's give our specialist a chance to do things his own way and... well, just rest assured that I won't allow him to continue harassing people like this...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I wonder where Bronco the Kid got his nickname? I kinda want a nickname... Unsuur the Wise? Heh...}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I liked the Andy version of the bounty hunter better. At least with him on the case, there was some chance of Logan ending up behind bars.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|I don't want to hear any ifs, and, or buts about these specialist commissions, unless it's... If you want this wacky object made, normally it'd cost you an arm and a leg, but considering the circumstances, it'll be all four appendages! Nyeh!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|New guy came in, started stomping around the Moisture Farm. Squished a berry I was savin'. That was the last straw. Had to toss him out. Literally...}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Infer-structure? The heck y'all all talkin' about? Some rich fella aimin' to give y'all a whole mess of Gols? You need rocket launchers! Bazookas! Machine guns! Why blow that kinda spendin' money on boring ol' roads and tunnels. Ooh, wait, I got it: use the bazooka to make the tunnel! See? Everyone wins!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|When Trudy asked me not to try to sell anything to Musa, I felt so called out! I mean, that's exactly what I was planning on doing! I'm honored that she knows me so well...}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|If money is the root of all evil, why is Musa such a good person? Hm. Well. I'm sure there are no other inconsistencies in my beliefs.}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Musa is coming...! Here! They say, "Never meet your heroes," but... is there a second part to that phrase? Why not!? I can't wait to meet my hero! I've already asked Trudy to bring him to the recently upgraded Game Center, heh heh heh...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|We should support rich folk like Musa. I think they should be able to do pretty much whatever they want to whoever they want, they earned it! Sure, I don't have a billion Gols right now. But someday I might. And then guys like me better watch their step!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I say we oughtta reach out to Meidi for investment. Musa, sure, he's got a good track record. Spotless really. But wouldn't you rather have people backing us who care more about the envrionment? Musa's a money man. He'd waste water if there was profit in it, I bet you...}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|So one guy is gonna come visit for a day and decide whether or not we get the money that might save our town? This is why I hate society!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Hm... Trudy is very concerned with impressing Musa. If this were a novel, certainly foreshadowing would imply that she is almost guaranteed to fail. Luckily, this is real life, so I'm sure everything will go exactly as planned.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Expecting something cynical, sarcastic, perhaps even with a dash of snark? Well, I normally I would but... I got nothin'! Musa is awesome, I'm a big fan. I mean. Okay minor gripe: nobody should have that much money. But if it had to be someone, why not Musa?}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|I actually met Musa once when I was a kid! My Pa took me to a "Young Bridgebuilder" convention; my team took first prize! I wonder if he remembers...}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Trudy wants us all to be on our best behavior, even if that means acting different. But... if Cooper isn't allowed to go on hour tangents... I'll admit, the notion is difficult to protest.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Hey! What's the richest cow in the world called? ...Mooooo-sa!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Wow... the first time anyone's ever taken my suggestion seriously at a Fireside meeting! Things could really be changing around here, ''Player''! Just wait til they hear my next idea... an underground network of trains, connecting every major location in Sandrock! We'll cut down Yakmel traffic by half!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah, Musa coming to town is cool and all, but... man! It's a lot of pressure for me and Unsuur. I've had Grace take Duvos Peppers off the menu for a while. Can't have another repeat of the Little Wood incident...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Dang, I wish Pebbles was old enough to remember meeting Musa... Ah, I know! I'll snap a photo of 'em together, then tell Pebbles when he's older Musa said he seemed destined for greatness. Then I'll hold that over his head til he's 35. Hah! Parenting!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I tend to stay out of politics; who is this Musa character? Uh huh... He owns the train stations, the electric company, and the water works? Well... that sounds like a bit of a monopoly to me!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|I'm impressed Trudy managed to set up a meeting with Musa, I'm just afraid she's gotten in a bit over her head. She's been nervous lately. Moreso than usual.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Musa's coming to town! Don't worry so much about meeting a famous person: they're just like us regular folk! Just with more money and cooler jobs and more influence and more charisma and... ah... ah!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Musa is coming to visit our town... and still bandits roam our dunes as they please. The specialist is nowhere to be seen... I'm beginning to... lose interest in all this. If you need me, I'll be in my dormitory...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|So we got off on the wrong foot with Musa, big deal. I give bad first impressions all the time! Trust me, they're overrated. It's as simple as: S. A. C... Smile, apologize, and charm!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Well... I know I shouldn't have gone into the kitchen and started pushing buttons but... When Owen told me "I sure could use some help with the party," and... well, I just couldn't help not going in there to help!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Musa thinks I'm a fool. Musa thinks we're all idiots. Will there ever be a last time I have to say this? This is the worst day of my life. But... don't worry, ''Player''. I'm handling it well. I always do.}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|That robot went crazy at Musa's welcoming party! I told everybody we've gotten too lax over at the Church! We need to be more careful, and stop listening to that research guy just because he uses big words!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|The way things went at the Blue Moon... How cartoonish. The only thing missing was someone getting hit on the head with an anvil.}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|I'm not usually one for "I told you so's," but I still think just bein' ourselves, goin' about our lives as normal would've been a fine enough way to impress Mr. Musa. Although, reckon I do agree the station was in need of a tune up...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|It truly is a miracle Mort was able to change Musa's mind about us. I hate to be cruel, but it wouldn't be completely incorrect to suggest that this incident has given us some indication as to who is and isn't pulling their weight around here...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Hm... I wonder if Heidi will write an article on the Blue Moon disaster... I mean, it is news, but it just makes us look bad...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Okay, we still have a chance to prove to Musa we're competent people. Picture this: Me. In gladiatorial combat. Against an Alpha Yakmel. With my shirt off. ...With mud. ...Oh, come on! It's not like anyone has any better ideas! Just... don't rule it out, alright, Skinny?}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Could the party at the Blue Moon have gone better? Yes. Could it have gone worse? Eh... not really. Can we recover from this? I'm hopeful.}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I shot that mech good. Dang robit. Git outta my saloon, dang it.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Yes, yes, I heard about what happened at the Blue Moon... let's all just be thankful that no one got hurt. And that Musa changed his mind and gave us another chance! Actually, it's really not that bad at all when you think about it...}}

{{dialogue|Yan|How am I supposed to scam Musa when you lunatics almost scare him out of town on the first day! Freaking amateurs... No, no... I'm sorry to yell... Not you, newbie... you're one of the good ones. Er. Passable ones.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Got butterflies in your stomach? I sure do. Musa's backing us, which is great news, but I don't think I need to remind you who else might be interested in this road. We're going to be running double shifts at the Corps from here on until it's done.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|I'm excited about the road announcement! Haven't seen my old Portia pals in a panbat's age. Well. Better not get too worked up, eh? It's going to take a pretty long time to finish the tunnel, won't it? You guys are drilling through, what, five leagues of rock? More?}}

Title: Recently Repugnant Reflective Rat Relic Recovered
In a surprise turn of events, Bronco the Kid's investigation has produced actual results. No, that is not a misprint. I'll write it out again: Bronco the Kid's investigation has produced actual, evidence-based, factual facts. Not a complete failure, not a waste of time: actual results.

Okay, you can undrop your jaw now.

The details of the mission are currently classified, but we did manage to get a snippet of information from Bronco himself who said, "Logan! He's so close... I can taste him!" To which this reporter responded, "You don't have to do that."

In another twist, Bronco's escapades led to ''Player'' and the Civil Corps getting caught up in some sort of Bandirat power struggle between a queen and a princess, also classified, which led to them defeating and subsequently recovering a rare, Old World AI Mirror robot. The fate of this robot is still up in the air.

But, if we do manage to get a handle on this former kill-bot, we're sure to have gained a powerful ally in our neverending quest to... get fashion advice from robots?

All in all, it's been a big win for Sandrock. Most interactions with Bandirats end with some items being stolen, but we walk away this time just a little bit richer.

Title: Builder Back from Beyond! Criminal Circumvents Capture
So there's good news and bad news. And, if you read the title, you've got the gist of both already! But let's start with the good news.

''Player'' is alive!

Yes, for a brief period of time, we all thought we'd lost one of the best and most beloved Builders in our community. According to eyewitness reports, ''Player'' was seen careening over a cliff to certain death, so, y'know. One can't really be blamed for assuming the worst.

But luckily, ''Player'' somehow... survived! Hm, guess I really should've asked about that. Definitely a key fact here in this story... Well, sorry about that, ''Player'', you'll have to fill us in another time.

And now for the bad news...

Unfortunately, the top secret plan to capture Logan alluded to in our previous article led to a dead end. Following the near-death experience of ''Player'', the Civil Corps has decided to reassess the strategy.

Weighing in on the situation, Civil Corps' Justice had this to say:

"We don't want to send the message that someone can just waltz into Sandrock, commit crimes, and get away with it. They cannot. I'd like to emphasize that we only look so incompetent capturing Logan because he is really, really good at what he does. So unless you think you can operate on his level, I highly recommend that you not test your luck here with the law."

{{dialogue|Arvio|You won Workshop of the Year? That's great! When's the ceremony for regular shop of the year? Eh? What do you mean there isn't one!? This is a travesty! Well. Congratulations, anyway!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Yippee! Yahoo! Hooray for you, Builder! Builder of the Year! Workshop of the Year! Three cheers for you, ''Player''! Hip hip... hooray! Hip hip... hooray! Hip hip-! W-wait, don't go, I still have one more cheer...!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Seein' all your success over at the Commerce Guild... Kinda makes me think... Maybe I'm gonna make it, too! Here's to success, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Heard about your little win over at the Commerce Guild. Yep, that's right, you know me, always in the know. Now, I'm here to offer you a bit of advice; you know I been around the bend once or twice, now, listen. Don't let it get to your head! Lotta people win one award, think they're on top of the world, but the sad reality is that there is no top of the world. Because the world is flat! Think about what I said...}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|You won the Workshop of the Year award, how inspiring! How can I be more like you? I'm always trying to improve myself! ...Uh huh... yeah... Wow, that's amazing advice! I'll start right away!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Wow, you're the number one Builder! I never been number one at nothin'... What's your secret!? ...Uh huh? ...Uh huh... Aw, that sounds like way too much work, I ain't doin' that!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Builder of the Year! Quite the accomplishment. Keep it up and maybe I'll be writing your biography one day! Let's spice it up a little though, give you an evil twin or something...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|Congratulations. I have heard... you are best in your guild.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Wow. Workshop of the Year, huh? Well. I always thought you were great. Glad you've got a trophy now to back up my theory!}}

{{dialogue|Haru|Congrats on your win! Perhaps there will be an opportunity for us to work together down the road! I'm looking forward to learning from you.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Look at you, beaming! If I didn't know, I'd have guessed already: I'm face to face with the Builder of the Year! Well, can't say I'm surprised. You put in the work, now it's time to reap the rewards!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Workshop of the Year... and so soon after getting here. Most Builders strive their whole lives just to get on the charts, but you... well, I'll just say this, ''Player''. You've earned my respect, for what it's worth.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|And the Workshop of the Year award goes to... Mr. Teddy! Oops, sorry, ''Player''! Better luck next time!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Oh my... I'm in the presence of greatness.. None other than ''Player'', the Builder of the Year! Any words for your fans out there across the Free Cities? Hm? Ah... Oh, wow, that's good! I'll have all my conductors use that line over the intercom!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Hey, Builder! Or should I say, Builder of the Year! Heh heh! Yeah, that's right, I heard! Congratulations! You've really made a splash in this town, I'm just glad to know you!}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Wow! How do ya become Builder of the Year, anyway? Build the most stuff? Oh yeah... Yeah, guess that makes sense. Well, good on ya, Builder! Congrats on buildin' all that... uh... stuff!}}

{{dialogue|Logan|Builder of the Year? Now that's somethin' I can respect!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Oh, look who it is! Sandrock's number one Builder! Of course, you were always my number one Builder. Though I'm sure it don't bother you none now that it's official, hm?}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|I remember when you were first registering your workshop with me; I feel so fortunate to have been able to see you grow and flourish like this, ''Player''. Congratulations again on winning Workshop of the Year!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|You looked cool up there on that podium, holding that award, ''Player''! Humble, yet dignified! All the other Builders agreed, too: you totally earned that win!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|As the recipient of the Workshop of the Year award, you've only proven yourself to be more invaluable than we already believed. I've spoken with the Civil Corps about keeping an eye on you; your success is welcomed, but it may attract unwanted attention... Stay vigilant, Builder.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Builder of the Year... We don't get much time at the top, if any at all. Try to enjoy it while it lasts...}}

{{dialogue|Musa|Congratulations, ''Player'', on winning Workshop of the Year. I knew from our first conversation something like this was inevitable.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|You won Workshop of the Year? That's incredible! You beat out your boss and he's been in the biz forever! I'm sure he took it well, being an old head and all... In fact, I'll bet he's real proud of you!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Ever since you won the Workshop of the Year award, I've had a few of the out-of-town Builders stop in and ask for your haircut. You really did a number on those folks, huh? Well. Don't tell them it won't help...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Huh? You won Workshop of the Year? Wow, ''Player''. Uh... piece of advice: no one likes a showoff. Maybe dial it back a little bit? Sheesh.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|I've heard that you received commendations for being outstanding in your field; well done. Finally, someone in this town I can consider as a peer...}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Heard you won Workshop of the Year, pretty chill. Here's my take, though: not to, like, besmirch your achievements or whatever, but, uh, the whole thing is just a scam to make you work harder for not much in return. Stop by my place sometime when Dan-dan's not around and I'll show you how to be a real winner... like me.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Yo! Builder of the Year! It's an honor to know that you smashed up our scrap on your way to the top... Hey, can you sign my Pickhammer? Ah, dang it, I don't have a pen...}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I saw the results of the Workshop of the Year ceremony. We really struck gold, getting you to come out here, I... just feel like I don't say that enough. Thank you, ''Player'', for working so hard! We'll keep pushing ourselves to match your diligence!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Winning the Builder of the Year award... That's kinda like becoming deputy of the Commerce Guild, huh? I'm so... jealous...}}

{{dialogue|Venti|I heard you get a big bonus after winning the Workshop of the Year! I bet you're rearing to get back to work now!}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|You look like you just won a million Gols, ''Player''! What's the occasion...? ...Is that so! Gosh, Workshop of the Year? And the ceremony was just right next door? Shoot, I'm sorry I missed your big moment! Hope it's not too late to congratulate you!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|As it turns out, I forgot to count some of my commissions towards the Workshop of the Year award, you know, because I do so many! So... you didn't really win. Unfortunately it's too late for me to reverse the results, so I guess we'll just have to both live with the fact that you're a fraud for the next year. 'Til next time!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Workshop of the Year, huh? How many other guys did you edge out? Four? Eh... well, that's pretty good, I guess... Sorry, er... I don't ever know what to do in these kinds of situations... But... I always thought you were great. Award doesn't change anything. Er. I mean it's a fine award- Ah, dang it...}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|Sometimes I feel frustrations; like Arvio and I couldn't be more different. Imagine being related to Yan...}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Considering I was able to fool most of these townies with a wig I nicked off a barber, hardly comes as a surprise that y'all couldn't tell the difference between them Yan brothers. Here's what you oughta build next: an optometrist's office!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Yan came into my shop and didn't even try to shoplift anything! Do you think he's turned over a new leaf? What? A... twin!? Are you sure, ''Player''? Wow... I guess... Yan becoming good is more farfetched than him being an evil twin, thinking about it.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|When Wei says nice things, I can pretend it's Yan saying them, and then it feels like Yan is actually my friend! Sometimes, in the quest to befriend everyone, you have to bend the rules a little...}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Yan was the first commerce commissioner I actively worked with. This new guy. Whew. Like night and day. I never realized how bad we had it before...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Sure, Yan was a rotten, lyin', no-good, ugly mug that only a mother could love. Greedy. Deceitful. Demented. Half-wit on a good day. Really thought less of everyone around him. The case might be made that the world would simply better without him. He's a thief, a degenerate, a juggler, hypocrite and a snake. But he was our snake, dang it. And he shall be sorely missed.}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|That's not how all twins work, right? One good one, one evil one? I had kind of been hoping for twins myself, but now I'm not so sure...}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Wish I had a twin. Not an evil one, though. Or maybe... Well, I reckon havin' an evil twin opens up a lot of possibilities for adventure. Color me undecided on the issue for now!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Yan is a twin? An evil twin? I thought that only happened in stories, I didn't think it was ever a real thing... And... they're both on different sides of the law? I mean... come on...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|Your new leader. He is... respectable?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I almost pulled the same move as Justice when I saw Yan's twin brother. It was only after noticing an extremely subtle microexpression that I knew Wei wasn't just Yan acting like another person. Yan just... doesn't have anywhere near that level of skill.}}

{{dialogue|Haru|As good as you are, ''Player'', I'm quite looking forward to seeing what happens in town now that you have a competent commissioner helping you behind the scenes.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|With the new commissioner in town, we can get back to work on the tunnel to Portia! You, er... remember that's what we were doing before the whole city-wide emergency thing, right...?}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|I feel for Wei. I mean, somewhere, deep down, he's got to have some love for his brother. It must be hard to deal with family like that. People who have just completely lost their way...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Yan and Wei are like complete opposites in every way! For example: Yan smells like garbage, whereas I'm pretty sure Wei uses cologne...}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|The car where Yan got punched in the face now has a plaque there to commemorate the event. Even his own brother appreciated seeing it on his way over.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Havin' the brother of a criminal replace him...  Even if he is on the level, isn't that some kinda conflict of interest? Eh. Well, no one's brought it up. Last thing I need is to get strung into Commerce Guild drama. Those guys are nit. Picky! Er, not you though, ''Player''...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Innocent until proven guilty and all that, but, uh... I think me an' Rocky are gonna have a real hard time trusting this Wei character. I mean... he looks just like Yan! That's gotta affect us on like, a... psycho... logical... somatical... kinda level or somethin', right!?}}

{{dialogue|Logan|New guy Wei seems fine enough. Wonder what happened to Yan that screwed him up so bad in comparison. Ah, well. Let the shrinks in Atara sort him out.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Consumer prices are down and quality up over at the Commerce Guild! Did you know... that that whole 'waitin' in line even though you're the only person in the guild' thing is somethin' the old commissioner just made up...?}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Have you met our new commissioner yet? He's lovely! I guess since this was my first job, I never really had anything to compare the experience to. Do you think... Do you think Yan was... a bad boss...? I mean. You know, in addition to all the crime stuff.}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Yes. You all are free from Yan's loathsome presence. I however, am forced to bask in it...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|What a bitter, hate-filled man, that Yan. And to think... all these years he had a brother...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|So Yan has always been part of a "good twin, evil twin" situation... and Yan is the evil one? That explains a lot...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Yan's twin looks so much younger than him; that's what evil does to your skin! So... think happy thoughts! Although... evil old men always live to be like a hundred so... I guess... take your pick.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|The twin commissioners are a fantastic study in the nature vs. nurture issue. Of course, these two men have identical DNA, so what exactly led them to become such different people? Hypothesis one: it's the mustache.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Oh no, with Yan out of the picture and the new commissioner so competent, I'm now the most useless person in Sandrock. I... gotta be better! For Dan-dan and my unborn child!}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|I'm gettin' fricken flashbacks lookin' at that Wei character. Looks like the mopstick. Talks like the mopstick. Walks like the mopstick. But brother... that ain't no mopstick. I'm... I'm sure I'll get over it...}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I've got Mr. Wei checking our old contracts; turns out... I really missed a lot of red flags over the years. I mean, I always knew Yan was obnoxious, I just... I thought he was paid well enough not to steal from us...!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|With Wei around, it kinda feels like Yan is still a member of town. Except he's, like, good. Most bad guys we meet end up being misunderstood and eventually turn good. It's almost as if... The only way Yan could ever be good is if he were a different person completely. Hm...}}

{{dialogue|Venti|I heard you got a new Commissioner! Did he increase your salary? New healthcare plan? Well, at the very least, is he providing free mustache removals?}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I dunno how we ever let Yan become commissioner in the first place. I guess we were just in a rough spot back when Lou and Email left... no one really bothered to fight it... Pay attention to local politics, ''Player''! Don't let this happen to your generation!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Hey! Newb- er... It's me! Your buddy, Wei! My mustache grew back really fast and, well, I'll spare you the details... I seem to have accidentally locked myself in here. Can you get the key, pretty please?}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Yan tried to have his own brother killed? Wow... lock him up and throw away the key. I always knew he was a crook, but that's twisted.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Y'all should be holdin' a parade for Logan, and instead, he's goin' in the slammer! This is injustice, this is a travesty, the trial was a pig circus, this is the greatest mishandling of justice in the history of the Free Cities! I'll take this to the highest court in the land! ...Where is that, again...?}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|I learned about this idea called... "letter of the law!" The idea that you just blindly follow laws exactly as they're written, even if it goes against the spirit of the law... I didn't even know there was an alternative! Anyway. Everyone's been accusing me of doing that lately...}}

{{dialogue|Catori|You know, if I'm being honest... I'm coming around on the "Logan goes to jail" idea. We don't want tourists thinking we're a lawless land out here. Besides, it's just a slap on the wrist...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|I'm gonna level with you, ''Player''. My opinion of right and wrong is as fickle as a tumbleweed in a sandstorm. I basically just go along with whatever seems to align with whatever my personal interests are at the time. Perhaps, once, I was a primary advocate for putting Logan behind bars, yes... But, well... you know what? I've changed my mind. And I'll do it again, too!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|There's really not much vindication in punishing someone who wants to be punished. I prefer my moral choices to be no more complex than any novel where the hero is a dog.}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Logan got a few days in the slammer? Hah! Suckers. That's nothin'! He's basically got off scot-free! Looks like my petition really worked...!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|I think I'm going to adjust my novel a bit, have my character do more nefarious things than Logan did. At Logan's actual trial, it was so obvious he was in the right that it just doesn't make for much of a narrative...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|Logan... is right. No one... should be above the law.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|It would've been so easy to talk City Hall out of putting Logan in prison, but... that's what he wanted. I mean... it's a short sentence, really just a farce we're all going along with to make him feel better. But whatever. Problem solved. Sheesh, he can be a real kid sometimes...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Trudy was pretty torn up about having to draft up the papers putting Logan and Haru in prison... I was, too. But you know... funny thing is... least bothered of all seems to be... Logan and Haru...!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Bit of time inside'll be good for Logan. He's not the kinda guy who wants to "get away" with anything. He wants to own up to his mistakes, and I have a great deal of respect for that.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|I'm still mad they didn't let me vote at the trial. I'm old enough to know that my friend is a hero, not a criminal!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Life of crime is like traintracks... only goes one way. Although. I guess... you could make amends and right your wrongs. Reform. Become a better person. Okay, let's go with... a life of crime has the potential... to be traintrack-like. Yeah.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Kind of a waste to put a hero like Logan in the clink, but... if this little charade is what gets him back in folks' good graces, guess I'll keep my head down and follow orders...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|How's Logan gonna pay those fines? It's not like they were rakin' it in as bandits... Seems kinda wrong to pile debt on somebody who's famously broke.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I think this way everyone gets about what they want... Logan and Haru are real sports for turnin' themselves in like that. Shows that we're a town of law and order, but not to the point of being cruel or unusual.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|On the topic of Logan's trial: two wrongs don't make a right. But I guess one right cancels out one wrong, kind of?}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Logan is welcome company, comparatively. Sure, I don't doubt he hates me for all I've done, but... still an improvement.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|The real crime committed is our society pushing a good man to do such desparate things to survive.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|That Logan... hardheaded as ever. I hope he'll let me deliver meals while he's in there. The prison food... well... it's prison food, ''Player''.}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|I mean... everyone likes Logan, so of course we're going to make up reasons to bend the rules for him. I don't really know why societies even bother having laws at all. We always just punish people we don't like and reward ones we do...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Seems kind of pointless to me to have all these laws and then decide that we only want to follow some of them when push comes to shove just because we "feel" like Logan shouldn't be punished. I'd suggest creating a law specifically for this type of situation, problem solved.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Good thing late commissions aren't a crime. Otherwise I probably would've been commissioned to make a gallows by now. Which... I think, understandably, I'd probably take my time with.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|I prefer puttin' guys like Yan on trial. No grey area there, just bang, zoom, straight to the moon!}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Hello, ''Player''... I'm sure you've heard about City Hall's decision. I... think what we did was the right thing. In any case, I think we can count on things returning to normal soon enough.}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Lately we've had tons of people in jail, which has been great for me. Always have someone to talk to at work. Logan said there's some cool rocks at his hideout, we're gonna go when he gets out.}}

{{dialogue|Venti|Well, if Logan can't pay the fines, he can always come to the mines! Hey, that rhymes! Maybe that should be our recruitment slogan!}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I went ahead and signed Elsie's petition knowing full well that petitions can't change the law but... well, I think it made us all feel better...}}

{{dialogue|Wei|Normally I think everyone should do their civic duty and vote! I, however, had basically no knowledge of the Logan ordeal and thought it best I abstain.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Uh. I vote to keep Logan out of jail. What!? Having a felony voids my right to vote? Why, that's a travesty! Oh, twelve felonies, you say? Hm. Yes, well, I suppose that's fair...}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Can't be too mad at Logan. I like to get my hands dirty, too. Er... Just a bit of... gardener humor for you. Maybe... ill-timed...}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|It is the best of omens that as our town grows, so too, do our enemies diminish.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|I think Larry is awesome! He's already told me all kindsa cool stuff about world domination 'n battles n' some Old World thing called the in-ter-net... wait a sec, do I have a thing for bad boys?}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Wow, I never thought I'd have to stock my store with the Geegler demographic in mind! So... what do I need... Like... bugs and heatlamps?}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Larry did have trash thrown in our oasis... but... he did also karmically plunge to what should have been certain death... Alright, I'd say the punishment fits the crime. Let 'im in!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Long as he doesn't like... drool on my machines or whatever, then, yeah, sure. We can have the Geegler guy in town. But, eh, let's just call this a trial period, y'know?}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|You keep yer eye on that lizard feller, I tell you what. It has been said before that lizards are actually the ones who pull all the political strings over in Atara. If this really is their attempt to flip us, too, I must say they've gotten bold!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Larry had better not be a bad influence on the kids in town. If he is: right back in the canyon!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|It's fun gettin' to know this new lizard feller; you know, it's weird how the Geeglers are different from their regular lizard ancestors. Most lizards like to rest in the dark after they warm themselves up on a rock or somethin', but Larry... I think he's afraid of the dark.}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Larry the Geegler seems like the kind of character a writer would add into an otherwise boring story to try to be wacky and appeal to kids. But I'm sure he's a great guy.}}

{{dialogue|Fang|I swore... to do no harm. Even our enemies... I will heal them.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Am I really gonna lose my place in the kitchen to a Geegler...? Hm. Well, glad you two are friends now. But Larry and me... we've got unsettled business...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Little known fact: there are actually a decent number of mutant animals co-existing peacefully in the Free Cities. I hear that in Portia, for example, has a giant bear that's sweet as a button! Hopefully one day all of 'em come around...}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|What's that guy's name? Larry? Well, if y'all are sure he's learned his lesson. I trust Trudy's judgement.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Larry got a lot smaller. How do lizards measure themselves? Do they use their... scales?}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I'm going to have a hard time trusting that Geegler man... he tried to use trains for evil!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|I always believed we could make peace with the Geeglers; sure, they're weird but... they're sentient creatures, y'know? Guess ol' Larry had to hit rock bottom to finally realize his mistakes. Oop. Didn't mean for that to be in poor taste...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Hm... if we were able to overcome our differences with the big mean lizard guy, do you think... maybe Rocky and Yan could have sorted things out peacefully? ...Nah.}}

{{dialogue|Logan|I'm not worried about that big fella movin' into town. You took care of him once. If he acts up, we'll do it again, together.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Quickest way to a monster's heart is through their stomach! I fixed up ol' Larry with a pie I thought he'd appreciate, and now I reckon we're all straightened out! Oh. I, er, would share the recipe but... well, there's bugs in it...}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Are you okay, ''Player''? Can you really just forgive a guy you battled on top of a train? Really? All water under the bridge? Er- Sorry, I was being serious...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|I've always assumed that all the experimentations from the Age of Corruption were inherently bad, that's why I was so very much against any Geegler interference in our town. Now that this Larry is actually living in town... I don't know how to feel...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|The best way to lose an enemy is to gain a friend. Well done, ''Player''.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Larry's not half bad in the kitchen! His superior sense of smell allows him to get the flavors juuuust right! Unfortunately, he doesn't like most human food, so he is cursed to lead others to a treasure he cannot possess...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Sure, let's let the lizardman join the town. It's avant garde!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|I'd like to get a bone sample from the Geegler to examine how he might've survived that fall. Do you think you could handle that? Hm? Well, just beat him up again! What? You did it before...}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Got a new side-hustle... sellin' termites to Larry... Pretty sweet gig, cuz he, like... doesn't really know what money is yet.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|What? They got the lizard guy doin' shifts at the Blue Moon? Send 'im over to me! Bet that guy could lift a truck! Oh, he lost a lot of weight? Huh. Well. Offer stands.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I have to admit, Larry is the strangest addition we've ever had to our town, but for the most part, people are warming up to his cool-blooded charm...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Howlett told us before that the Geeglers were at peace with us, then they weren't, and now one of them is. It's confusing...}}

{{dialogue|Venti|Where will Larry live? In a house decorated like a cave? Or a cave decorated like a house?}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Those lizards gave us trouble ever since I was young. Who knew they really could be reasoned with? Guess Howlett and B3 were right all these years...}}

{{dialogue|Wei|I'd heard Sandrockers were unconventional, but I never thought I'd be living alongside a monster not unlike the kinds I used to see in the Periphs... I hope this is wise, ''Player''...}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Yeah. I remember that guy. Sent his goons to start fires in the Moisture Farm. Not a fan. I'll give him a second chance, but keep an eye on 'im.}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|It must be pleasant to know that the equipment you're building is what will restore Sandrock's environment to what it was all those years ago. I greatly look forward to seeing the results of your success.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|They're gonna build a school after this? Huh... not sure how I feel about that... On one hand, I hate school. On the other, they make me go anyway, and our current set-up, well, Heidi's fine but... Burgess and Dan-bi... I don't think they... like... know a lot of stuff...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Well... Trudy is now in contact with Musa for all these projects, right? Sounds to me like the deal is pretty well sealed!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Can't wait to get that Portian water out on our soil! I wonder if plants can taste the difference? Portian water offers a low-mineral, refreshing taste... But who could dare turn their nose up at the rustic flavor profile that our own local water provides? Sigh... I may never choose a favorite!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|I don't think I'm ready to be a part of all this development meeting stuff yet but... if everything they're doing really works... Ah. Well. Nevermind, ''Player''. Let's not get our hopes up...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|For my contribution to Sandrock's development, I wanted to breed super Yakmel, but science feller says there's "rules" again' it... See this is how you kill a fandom, ''Player''. All this gatekeepin'. I coulda been a fine member of the community, but now... I hate science!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I want to move forward with our next phase of planting as soon as possible; the faster we do that, the faster we get the school. And the sooner we get the school, the more time they have to build some experience before my kid'll go there...!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Will Sandrock really be Sandrock without the sandstorms? I, too, have pondered on this conundrum, and allow me to present you with my conclusion. Yes! Sandstorms are horrible! Anyone who says otherwise is just bein' nostalgic.}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Logan wants us to build a monster hunting outpost after we're done with the forest? I smell "sequel..."}}

{{dialogue|Fang|Trudy and Zeke... never give up. I admire that.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|With all the spies taken care of, my work here is pretty much done. I'd intended to kind of just... rest here for a while. But I do find myself getting weirdly invested in this whole Sandrock greenery thing...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|How's the irrigation tech going? Don't worry, this'll all be worth the struggle. Hang in there!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|You really have to admire Trudy and Zeke's dedication to this project. Seems no matter how many setbacks we face, they're always ready to jump right back on the saddle again.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|It seems like everybody listens to what my Ma says these days. That's pretty cool! I guess the moral is, do a great job and everyone will respect you! Or is it... keep repeating the same thing over and over until everyone believes it...?}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I've always seen Cooper as a loud, disruptive, frustrating, self-centered, morally dubious kind of person... but as of late, we've had a lot to talk about! I guess anything's possible in this world...}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Been nice to get some R&R lately! Now, I don't wanna jinx it, but... Not one... Not one! Not one thing has exploded in this town since the whole Duvos ordeal. I know! It's one of those things you don't even notice is gone...}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|I'm excited that our next plan is to build a school. Pebbles is gettin' to be about that age... Me an' Rocky had to drop out so... it's been both our goals to get Pebbles a proper education.}}

{{dialogue|Larry|I have learned of your battleplans. To conquer the desert using greenery! It's madness. Goes against all conventions. I love it!}}

{{dialogue|Logan|Lotta opportunity on the horizon. Which means, everybody's gonna want their big idea to be what we do next. My monster hunter outpost... it can wait, I reckon. Unless more monsters show up...}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|It's nice to see Cooper and Jensen gettin' along. Cooper doesn't make a lot of friends... and if he does, there's usually a fallin' out within a few weeks... but... well, let's enjoy this while it lasts.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|When I help Zeke at the Moisture Farm, I mostly do busy work; I'm still learning the ropes. But one thing I think I've really helped him with is his confidence! I think it makes him feel better knowing that we do really care about what he's doing.}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Trying again with the greenery? Well. Though I did try to snuff it all out for my goal before, I'm sure it would be a sight to see...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|So it seems... almost everyone in town is in support of Trudy and Zeke's environmental plans. Absolutely incredible.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|I don't need to ask for anything at any development meetings... If you guys pull through with this whole green thing, I'll get exactly what I was hoping for... more fresh fruits and vegetables!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|For all of my cosmetelogical masterpieces ruined by sandstorms, I don't care what you all do to get rid of them, just get rid of them! You can use Penskies for fuel for all I care. What? Whaaat? I'm joking. Kind of...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Well. I shall be continuing my journeys over to the Starship Ruins. If you find anything interesting while digging around the sand in the Outback, let me know.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|You know, now that I've turned over a new leaf, I'm kinda thinkin' this new forest thing could be awesome. I could work with all kinds of new wood... maybe even finally see what it feels like to chop down a tree myself.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Yo, ''Player''! Heard you got another huge commission to do irrigation for the forest. Keep 'em comin'! You Builders are gonna put Pebbles through med school...}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|That meeting was pretty low stress! Although, I guess I put Zeke on the spot a little... Ah. He'll warm up to the stage. I just think it's so important to show everyone who we have to thank for getting us this far...!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|It feels like all the forces in the universe are trying to stop us from fixing the environment in Sandrock. Honestly, I've kind of enjoyed the challenge. It's been cool to see you guys all do such cool stuff, too. I wonder... if we save Sandrock... are we gonna be bored?}}

{{dialogue|Venti|If Eufaula Salvage gets the support of the town, then they can grow! And if they grow... I'll get a higher salary!}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Seeing Trudy step up and make all these plans for the future is really wonderful. Sometimes all you need is a little international conflict to give that confidence a nudge in the right direction!}}

{{dialogue|Wei|This greenification effort is something I'd read about before coming here. I'm very excited to see a bit of what you all do firsthand! Some are calling Mr. Zeke's work a miracle, you know?}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|I used to be minister, so I thought I'd take well to the stage, but... I dunno, somethin' about givin' a science report to the whole town... feels like a hard sell, I guess.}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|Sandrock is starting to look like old paintings. I... I'd better make sure I keep all my paintings of the oasis so we can share what these times were like one day...}}

{{dialogue|Andy|I'm cheerin' for ya, ''Player''. But, I gotta say I have one regret. Now that the oasis is soon to be cleared as a swimmin' hole... I never once snuck in to go skinny dippin' while Burgess was lookin' the other way. It's not the same if it's legal!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|I feel bad for anyone who invested in a lot of water before you guys did all this. But I feel good for... the remainder of the human race!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Oh, ''Player''! This is a dream come true! The water crisis... it's finally over! I mean... oh, geez, what am I gonna do now that I don't have the oasis to pine over... I've basically built my whole life around this...!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Wow, look at that oasis. Do we have water to spare now? Could I do like one of those water pistol games? Too soon?}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Awww man, I bought up a bunch of water just before y'all built that there pipeline, and now the price is in the gutter! I thought folk'd be willing to pay top Gols for my original, pre-drought, first edition water! It's mint condition!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Seeing this amazing oasis... ''Player''... I just want to thank you for doing so much for this town. I think... without all your hard work, me and Ri-ri might not still be here to witness this!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Maybe havin' more water'll finally be enough to convince Burgess to let some critters drink out of the oasis. I ain't holdin' my breath, though...}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|And with the water crisis solved, a new chapter begins for Sandrock... No doubt, you will continue to play a major role?}}

{{dialogue|Fang|The oasis... it looks wonderful. This... you and your friends did this...?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Leave it to Director Qi to find the solution to the town's problems and let it sit right in front of his face for a month. Well. Better late than never.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|We got those pipes up pretty quick, all things considered? I'm startin' to feel like we're in control here, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|It's really happening... you all are really turning things around...}}

{{dialogue|Jane|I suppose I consider myself "lucky" in a certain sense of the word... I'm one of the last people to ever get to see the dwindling oasis of Sandrock... From here on out, we'll all be looking at a new Sandrock...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Woooaaah! Have you seen the oasis? Of course you've seen the oasis, you were there when the pipe went on! That's craaazyyyy!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Is it... is it time to retire the water cars? Whew... guess I'll wait til I hear the word from the Mayor but... If'n that's the case, sure hope they get a spot in the museum!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Man, our town is lookin'... lush! Crisis-mode is what most of us were born in; it's hard to imagine... what to even do with all this water...!}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|So we got water now? Like, for real water? Not some buckets from Portia? I'm takin' Pebbles for a swim, I tell ya!}}

{{dialogue|Larry|Today I find it even more regrettable that I once sought to destroy this wonderful oasis of yours. It is now more bountiful than ever!}}

{{dialogue|Logan|Well, I'll be a Yakmel's uncle. Never thought I'd see the day. Good on ya ''Player''. Send my regards to all those that helped you make this happen. I'll raise a glass in your names.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Well, how about that! You all found enough water to fix the water crisis just like that! You know, it's always the last place you look...}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Been a while since we built something huuuuge, huh? Hahaha... I love it! Water for all! Whew... how do you handle building all these world-changing machines, I'm dizzy just from helping out...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|So in the end, Duvos led you to a new source of water... Ironic.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|I pray future generations will never have to understand the worth of water as we did... Thank you for all your efforts, ''Player''.}}

{{dialogue|Nia|The ball is rollin' now, huh? When I first wrote you, sounded like Sandrock was down and out, and now... well, look at this! This is a more modern water set-up than Highwind, I'd say...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Wow, never seen the oasis like that before... Even when I was a kid, I don't think the water got that high! What a time to be alive...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|With all this water, I'm finally going to be able to shampoo all of my customers equally from now on... Did I just say that out loud...?}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Shame the Portian water wasn't enough for us. Oh, well. Looks like science wins again.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|So now we can drink all the water we want? That's pretty cool. I guess the only disadvantage might be that I can't blame any late commissions on dehydration...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|The end of the water crisis is great for all kinds of reasons; but the little cherry on top? Now nobody's got any excuse for stinkin' up the ruins down there...!}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|The oasis... is full, ''Player''. For the first time since I can remember... Just seeing this will be enough to rally everyone; one more big push, that's all we're going to need...!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Dang we shoulda just gone up north to get that water like a hundred years ago.}}

{{dialogue|Venti|Even though there's water, you still need to be careful when playing in the water.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I think the real winners in all this are the children. You've helped build a school, solve the water crisis, and before long, Sandrock will be green again. They don't know how to thank you yet, ''Player''. But they'll remember when they get a little older.}}

{{dialogue|Wei|I'm starting to think there's nothing we can't do, ''Player''! An achievement like solving the Sandrock water crisis is sure to garner attention from all over the Free Cities! Don't act surprised when other guilds start asking us for advice...}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|With the water crisis being solved over-night like this... this changes a lot of things... Let's chat with Professor Luo soon. This water might be just the stroke of luck to push us over the finish line.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Logan said the forest was fighting the sandstorms. I wanna fight sandstorms, too!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Truly amazing! You know there's an old Barnarock phrase, "You can't break a rock without a hard place!" And while it's possible that I am misremembering exactly how that goes, I can't help but feel your achievements here ring true to whatever that phrase was supposed to mean!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|This is getting heavy... Am I really gonna document every single plant's location, age, and status across the entirety of Sandrock and the outback...? I mean, yes, of course, that was rhetorical but... it's gonna be a lot of work!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Sandrock, city of miracles! Repellers of Duvos, defeaters of the desert, and home to the Catori Entertainment Extravoplaza, where all your dreams can come true! I wonder what our next miracle will be? Although that's a bit of an ask, huh...?}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Trees to stop the sandstorms, well, shoot, I coulda told you that. Nobody listens to ol' Coop. Off his rocker, they say! Well, who's rockin' now? Hey, you ever seen that movie down by the museum? Heh heh! The people out there plantin' looked just like that cartoon lady from the museum movin' pictures! Truth is stranger than fiction, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|When me and Burgess work together, we're unstoppable! We're like a lean, green, plant-planting machine.}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I always knew Zeke had it in him to figure this stuff out. I just never thought it'd ever be anything like... this! He shoulda made it sound cooler! I think if we knew this was what we were gonna get, more people woulda been on board a lot faster...!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|What an incredible time to be alive... the whole town coming together for something greater than themselves... I have to write the news article.}}

{{dialogue|Fang|Sandrock... looks so lovely now. You have healed this place... from the brink of death.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|With the sandstorms weakened, countless lives will be saved every year. I guess the funny thing is, the people you saved... they'll never know you saved 'em. But don't worry. Everybody in Sandrock, and all across the Free Cities... We know you're heroes.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|For all the convoluted schemes I came up with to stop the sandstorms... you know once, I even proposed building a giant glass bubble... in the end, it was good ol' mother nature that saved us... with a little prodding from good folks like you and me!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|The Day the Sandstorms Stopped. Working title. I mean, c'mon, we've gotta write a song about something as monumental as this, don't we? Hopefully Coop and I'll play it for you next time you're in at the Blue Moon...!}}

{{dialogue|Jane|Wow, as soon as I get to Sandrock, everything starts to get so much more beautiful! Not that I'm taking credit for it...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|We did it! Sandstorms aren't gonna hurt anybody ever again! And our town isn't just looking better, you can see it on the faces of everyone you meet!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I don't want to be left out... Maybe I can get Zeke to hook my trains up with some plant decorations... Although, is that practical? Well, look how successful your campaign has been, ''Player'', you've even made me green. Green with envy!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Captain's taken aback by all this greenery, but don't worry, I have a feeling we can start growing him some new strains of sticky, icky catnip that'll keep any such anxieties in check.}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Wow, what a sight... to see a sandstorm start up... and just have the wind get taken out of its sails like that... I dunno if I'll ever get used to it. Something that used to frighten us... now it's nothin'...}}

{{dialogue|Larry|Your greenery has provided ample camouflage for Xena and I to set up an endless number of ambush points! Brilliant tactical decision, human!}}

{{dialogue|Logan|I like what you've done with the place, ''Player''. Can't say I hardly recognize it, but... I reckon it's somethin' I can get used to.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|When I heard someone say, "Everything's green!" I thought, "Oh no, not again!" But then it turned out to be the good kind of green! Which... you know... is good!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Remember that gardener-bot we smashed back in the shipwreck ruins? I'm gonna try to channel my inner squid-bot and work on this stuff like I've got eight legs! ...Or is it six...?}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|The wind picked up, but then lost momentum against the trees? Really...? I'd say I'd have to see it for myself, but, no... I believe you...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Our tree... up there on the cliff... it seems to be making a recovery...}}

{{dialogue|Nia|Sometimes it's the little details that matter most. Yes, our town is now ecologically stable. Do we need a bush structure of a Yakmel to improve any aspect of our environment on a practical level? No. Do I want one? Yes!}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Y'know, as a storyteller, it's somethin' else... to have gone halfway around the world, lookin' for stories to tell... when I easily could've just stood right here at my front door and watched the world pass me by...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Do my eyes decieve me... The sandstorm... stopped? My hair... it's unscathed... Everyone's hair...! Everyone's hair is fine, ''Player''! Oh, it's a miracle!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Now before you all go around patting yourselves on the back, let's not forget about some of the less positive aspects of your actions. We'll have to be accounting for more rainfall, and there may also be many who are allergic to the new flowers, especially in spring. Yes, yes, monumentous achievement, ''Player'', but we must always keep our heads on our shoulders, yes?}}

{{dialogue|Rian|That new forest has got Dan-dan all excited. She's out everyday planting trees... she's not even home to tell me to do anything. Best holiday ever.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|I like the funny grass statues. They're like statues, but they're bushes. What's goin' on with that? It's crazy.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I can't speak too much on it yet, but there might be something big happening here soon! Keep going with those sculptures, ''Player'', I'll let you know as soon as I can...!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I took up residence in Sandrock because I got lost in a sandstorm. If the sandstorms stop, that means nothing like that will happen again. I'm a dying breed, ''Player''...}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|You should see Mort's reaction to all this; he's absolutely beaming! Don't think I've hardly seen the man crack a grin in fifty years, and now he's all smiles!}}

{{dialogue|Wei|The Commerce Guild has got a whole bunch of commissions for gardening and planting. Seems like this green streak has really inspired a taste for nature in the folks around here!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Glad we found Burgess and Dan-bi something to do while we wait for the forest to rally. Those two have really grown on me, but they tend to struggle with just sitting tight and waiting things out...}}

Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|To see Sandrock filled with such color... it's just so beautiful. I just feel inspired. Every day I walk out of my door and I'm greeting with a feeling of awe.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Most of this stuff, I never seen before. Reckon I sorta assumed the whole world was sand. So many trees all together like this... it's like it all jumped out of one of Ms. Jane's picture books and now it's all... real!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Wow, Sandrock looks great! I've seen the old pictures, and... I daresay we're even looking a little better? Ooh, we're charting new territory, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|My title of safety inspector has changed, ''Player''... It... doesn't mean much anymore. And... that's okay. Because... now we're safe! Almost everything I ever worried about when you came here... it's not a problem anymore...}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Sandrock's getting more beautiful every day. The living sculptures are really something, aren't they? Hmmm, maybe I should consider these for a park expansion...!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Dagnabbit! I bet Hugo fifty Gols back 'round first Fireside Trudy came back that y'all'd never turn this desert green again. That's alright, you didn't know, ''Player''. And tellin' you would have bespattered the integrity of the bet! ...Can I borrow fifty Gols?}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Sandrock looks better than I ever could have imagined it! The sun is shining, birds are chirping, plants are blooming... we live in a paradise, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Sniff... sniff... so, the letter just flew into his hands? An' it was from Martle... an'... an'... if that ain't jus' the gosh dang saddest thing I ever heard...}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Yes, I've heard... I'm still processing it... A tale of eternal love... reaching from this world into the next...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|So Mort... waited all this time for...? Hm. I might have done the same.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Mission accomplished, ''Player''! Sandrock looks beautiful. Even in my line of work, it's rare you get to say "mission accomplished" and actually mean it, so I definitely wanted to get it in there.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|My Grandma used to tell me stories about when she was growin' up here, she said it used to be real beautiful before it all went downhill. It's nice, I kinda feel like I'm livin' in her childhood.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|I remember when Heidi came back to Sandrock on that train from Atara. I didn't know whether to shout or whether to cry with joy. I told her not to give up all her opportunities there to be back with us. ...It's good to be wrong sometimes, ''Player''. It's good to be wrong.}}

{{dialogue|Jane|A beautiful tree coming back to life... this is a wonderful teaching moment! A field trip might be nice... I'll have to keep an eye on Andy, though, I can't have him climbing all over it...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|So the Mama Tree is alive again? I'm gonna write a report on it. Then maybe we can even go on a field trip!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|With Sandrock being greener than ever, just think of all the tourists coming in... riding in the TX-350F, or a TX-370. Someday, if we all work together, we might even get a FR-987 to visit. Sigh... a man can dream.}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Dang, the tree's alive again? Me an' Owen used to climb it when we were little. Never really thought about it, but it's kinda a Sandrock staple.}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Those sculptures you all put up around town really bring everything together. I love our town now!}}

{{dialogue|Larry|The colors in this town are remarkable. The greens, the blues, the blurples. Hm? Can humans not see blurple? Interesting.}}

{{dialogue|Logan|When I was young, my Pa would take me to the tree. You could see all over Sandrock, perfect place for a campfire and recon.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I remember goin' up to that tree when I was young, Coop would sit on a rock and sing me the sweetest songs... it's lovely to see a piece of Sandrock history come back to life.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Is there such a thing as fate? If Martle never found this place, it never would have been settled. If Mort had never found Martle, this place would never have been restored. It seems like... both of them were tied to this place somehow...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Bravo, ''Player''... Bravo...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Martle... she's smiling down on us from up there. I can feel it.}}

{{dialogue|Nia|That letter... it got caught in the leaves of Mama Tree! If we'd never noticed it, cared for it... that letter would've slipped right through...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Wow, so Mort and Martle's tree came back to life? That's a nice little cherry on top of all this, huh! We should have little get-togethers up there like old times... those way, way old times...!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|I'm a little offended that they didn't call me to trim the living sculptures... I mean... giant Yakmel? That's... That's what they wanted to represent all of our town and what we've been through? Seems a bit on the nose, but what do I know...?}}

{{dialogue|Qi|A lot of people seem to be very excited about that one particular tree up on the mountain. I find it somewhat odd; there are ten thousand other trees exactly like it out there now.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|How am I supposed to keep on my new schtick of being a hard-working dude when everything looks so beautiful here now... Like, how am I not gonna just go over to that tree and take a nap under it? There's like... butterflies, dude...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Man, it's so nice to come out of the ruins and see all... this! Seein' so much green, it's like... how could I ever get mad at anythin' again?}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Mort and Martle... without either of them, none of this would've ever been possible...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Even moss grows on a rolling stone... eventually.}}

{{dialogue|Venti|When did all these sculptures appear? I fell asleep in the ruins, woke up, and they're all over town!}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|So you saved the tree? That's wonderful. I used to see Mort and Martle go there together... it always meant so much to him.}}

{{dialogue|Wei|Almost brings a tear to my eye, everyone bringing life back into this place. Sometimes I feel like Sandrock, thrown away by my brother, but managed to come back stronger than ever.}}

{{dialogue|Xena|This tree... it is important to the humans? How fortunate I did not eat it when the thought crossed my mind! Blessings to your sacred tree, strong human!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Life's funny I guess. In the moment, it can feel like nothing makes sense, but looking back, it's almost like everything really did happen for a reason...}}
