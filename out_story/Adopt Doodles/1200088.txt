{{dialogue|Elsie|Howdy there, ''Player''! Rise and shine! Ready for your surprise?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I just wanted to say... Even though we didn't find much pokin' around Logan's old homestead, well, you believed me when almost no one else did! So thanks, partner!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|But kind words ain't worth gills on a cat, so I did you one better and brought you this here baby Yakmel! His name is Doodles! But I reckon you could name 'im somethin' else if you wanted, 'cause he ain't quite learned it yet...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|With Doodles, you could get started with your very own ranch!}}

*''Wow, thanks!''
*''I don't want an animal...''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Wow, thanks!
|You hear that, Doodles? You've found a new and loving home! Hooray, ''Player''! Yeehaw!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|Oh, but shucks... ''Player'', you ain't got a Barn, do ya!? You can't take care of any animals if you don't have a Barn. Maybe you'd like for me to explain a thing or two about raisin' animals?}}

:*''Sure.''
:*''No thanks, I'll figure it out.''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|answer=Sure.
|If you wanna raise small animals, you gotta come over to my {{textcolor|green|Ranch Shop}} an' choose what ya like, either a calf or a chicken. Once you done bought it, it'll be delivered right away.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|{{textcolor|green|Y'know different animals need all sortsa different places to live}}. Rabbits like a Hutch, Yakmel need a Barn. You gotta have the right home for 'em if you want 'em to live with ya. If there's no {{textcolor|green|Barn}}, yer Yakmel ain't gonna wanna come live with ya!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|Jus' go see Heidi an' get her to fix ya up. Y'know, it was her {{textcolor|green|Construction Junction}} that helped us build our stables!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|Oh, and when you get your lil' animals runnin' about at home, remember to {{textcolor|green|feed 'em their favorite food an' play with 'em}}. If they're in a good mood, they'll grow up quick an' healthy!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|Well, I reckon that about sums it up.  I better be gettin' gone; I'm sure you and Doodles are gonna be right as rain, and I just know you're gonna take real good care of him... or else! So long, partner! Thanks for all your help!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|answer=No thanks, I'll figure it out.
|That's you, ''Player''! Always figurin' stuff out!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=double|Well, I reckon that about sums it up.  I better be gettin' gone; I'm sure you and Doodles are gonna be right as rain, and I just know you're gonna take real good care of him... or else! So long, partner! Thanks for all your help!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Huh!? Whaddya mean!? You tryin' to make me look ungrateful!? You tryin' to make Doodles cry!? You really sure you don't wanna start raisin' animals at your workshop? Look at him, he's so cute!}}

*''Fine, I'll take him.''
*''Sorry, I really don't want it.''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Sorry, I really don't want it.
|What kinda... of all the... Well, you heard the Builder, Doodles! Guess our kind ain't welcome 'round these parts! We'll be takin' our business elsewhere!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|''Player'', you come and find us if you change your mind. And best be quick! 'Fore we go changin' ours!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|Thanks again for your help with the investigation. But I am now officially ticked off over this! So many emotions!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Ah! That's what I thought!}}
