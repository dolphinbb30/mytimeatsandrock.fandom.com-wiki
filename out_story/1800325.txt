(cId 1) A conversation 3910_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Heidi|So Haru, how's the research? Anything you need to know? You know I'll help you out with whatever you need.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Oh, hey, ''Player''! Why don't you join us? Haru's making a big decision about where to go to school, and he needs some advice!}}

*''Sure, what's bothering you, Haru?''
*''Uh. Yeah. School. It's great. Whatever. Bye.''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Uh. Yeah. School. It's great. Whatever. Bye.
|Er... yeah...! Cool! Nevermind, then...}}
{{dialogue|Haru|I guess... I'm thinking about... where I belong. Director Qi spoke, at length, about the university in Vega 5... it seems like an amazing place, but their system sounds too rigorous to me.}}
{{dialogue|Haru|I feel like I'd be a little stifled there. The Director thinks I'd be better in a more open learning environment, too...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Ah, like Atara University, right?}}
{{dialogue|Haru|Yeah, I've contacted the admissions over there already, and they told me what I need to do to enroll.}}
{{dialogue|Haru|I was really worried that I didn't have the qualifications, but Mayor Trudy wrote a letter of recommendation for me. I just need to pass an entrance exam. So... maybe that's the way to go? But it's expensive...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Can't go wrong with Atara! And don't worry about tuition too much, plenty of people get scholarships to go in, and I reckon you're a shoo-in! Besides, there are competitions and internships to help you out too.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|You can do an exchange program in Vega 5 anyway, so you won't be missing anything by going with Atara U.}}
{{dialogue|Haru|Wow, I didn't know any of that. The idea of being in a real classroom is exciting, but intimidating... I only came to school in Sandrock for a couple of days before it shut down, so I ended up reading chemistry books on my own.}}
{{dialogue|Haru|I didn't really have anyone to tell me if I was wrong, so I'd just  experiment and see. I even had a few accidents which freaked Logan out a bit... What if my self-taught methods don't allow me to fit in at Atara U...?}}

*''University might not be as strict as you think...''
*''Relax Haru, you've got loads of experience!''
*''Learning on your own shows how capable you are!''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=University might not be as strict as you think...
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=2}}|Exactly! Heck, I used to squabble with my professors all the time! I got back to Sandrock and realized I was learning way more being on the job than I did from lectures!}}
{{dialogue|Haru|indent=true|Huh? You used to argue with your teachers? Were you allowed to do that?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Ahh! Well, not argue, per say... more like a debate! I mean, I mighta been a little hot-headed, but some teachers were stubborn as anythin'! Eh, point is: you don't have to worry about pleasin' everyone over there!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Relax Haru, you've got loads of experience!
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=2}}|Yeah for sure. Look, it's like a building, right? The deeper the foundation, the more stable the house. All that tinkering you've done, it's a great foundation for adding on more knowledge!}}
{{dialogue|Haru|indent=true|You can't go around digging foundations without a house, either. If you don't put anything on top, it's essentially just a hole...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Good point! Which is exactly why you need to get over there and get that diploma!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Learning on your own shows how capable you are!
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=2}}|Exactly! You've already learned so much on your own... Just imagine how much better it's going to be when you have experts to help you out! And trust me, Atara U has some of the best minds in the Free Cities!}}
{{dialogue|Haru|indent=true|I suppose if I can ask someone whether or not it's possible to do a thing, and they can tell me not to because they've tried it already... at the very least I'll be saving a lot of time.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|You got it! And, really... most folks lack the discipline to teach themselves much of anything, let alone something like chemistry. You're already leaps and bounds ahead of the other applicants, I reckon...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Anyway, regardless of where you go, I hope it all goes well. Can't wait to see your name attached to some groundbreaking discovery!}}
{{dialogue|Haru|Thanks. Talking to you two... I feel a lot better about the situation.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|You're doing the right thing. Your friends can come and visit you and... the years will pass by before you know it! Heck, send us your resume when you get out! We'll put you to work!}}
{{dialogue|Haru|Hard to say where we'll all be then, but... yes. That does sound very nice.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Back to it then?}}
{{dialogue|Haru|Yes, so long.}}
