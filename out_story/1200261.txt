{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|Maaaaaster~!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Er, hey, ''Player''! There's been... something of a development!}}

*''Ah. Hello, Rosy.''
*''Development?''
*''Look out, killer robot on the loose!''

{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|indent=true|answer=Ah. Hello, Rosy.
|HELLO. Master.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Look out, killer robot on the loose!
|Haha, no no, it's not like that anymore.}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|I'M. GOOD. NOW...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Aw, don't say it like that! You were always good. Just manipulated by an evil master! It could happen to anybody.}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|YOUR NUANCED VIEW OF GOOD AND EVIL IS A BREATH OF FRESH ELECTRICITY, MS. HEIDI.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Uh-huh! You're just lucky the city was able to see things my way...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So, ''Player'', just got off the telegraph with the Research Center folks over in Portia, turns out they had an AI not unlike our own literally fall out of the sky. Long story.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Anyway, their AI is unambiguously good. And answered all sorts of curious conundrums!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|The bad news: AI sadly do not dream of electric sheep. But good news: the whole "AI cannot lie" deal did turn out to be a thing. So that means everything Rosy here said is true!}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|I AM NOT A crook.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|That's right! Who's a good mirror? Who's a good mirror?}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|I am♫~.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Which brings me to why we are here!}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|LET ME serve you, master~...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Right, so I guess Rosy here really wants to {{textcolor|green|live in your yard, help you out in your workshop}}... if that'll make her feel at home and help you out at the same time, seems like a win-win to me, eh? What do you say, ''Player''? {{textcolor|green|Will you let Rosy work for you}}?}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Sounds great!''
