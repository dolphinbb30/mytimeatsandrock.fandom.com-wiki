Title: The Nested Bird Spreads His Wings
A review of "Diego's Mask"
The Free Cities' breakout hit, "Diego's Mask," has rocketed to the top of the best-sellers list with incredible speed. The newest book by Ernest is a massive departure from anything his readers will be familiar with. A bold new step, one that did not come without risk! Ernest has tackled accusations of nepotism throughout his career. I would argue, however, that he has overcome this and made a name for himself. 
To address the Yakmel in the room, yes, Ernest has highly benefited from his father's position. We can't deny that. But with the release of his latest book, Ernest has taken a jump into mature literature, that even the most weathered critic will find merit in. Ernest has even spent time researching his setting and theme directly, moving away from his lavish Atara home to the desert landscapes of Sandrock. 
I implore you, even those critical of Ernest's work, give "Diego's Mask" a chance, it may change the way you see the talent of this young man.
