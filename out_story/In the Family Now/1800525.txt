(cId 1) A conversation 8257_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Morning, ''Pet Name''! How'd you sleep?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Did I hog all the blankets again? I think I had a dream where I was a caterpillar. Sorry about that; you weren't cold were you? I'll try to be better. That's not something I want you to have to get used to...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|All things considered, I still think we're getting along well living together! It feels natural. Like it's already been forever! Forever in a good way.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Oh, you just missed Jasmine. She ran off after handing me this; it's a letter to us from my family. Shall we take a look? I guess it's a response to... me telling them we got married!}}

*''They're just now finding out?''
*''Sure, let's read it.''
*''Can you read it to me? Sorry, I think I caught a cold... Achoo!''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=They're just now finding out?
|Well, of course they know all about us! But, well, you know how things are. It's hard to get people to come out to Sandrock...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Sure, let's read it.
|Let's!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Can you read it to me? Sorry, I think I caught a cold... Achoo!
|Oh, ''Pet Name''...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|I'll find a way to make it up to you, I promise. Even if it means building something that makes the covers un-thievable!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Heh... but... hopefully it won't come to that. Now, how about that letter?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I am a little anxious about what my Grandpa might say...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I was a different person when I left Tallsky; still making all sorts of little careless mistakes in the workshop. And he always was sure to make that known...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I wonder if he still sees me as that reckless fledgeling, too eager to leave the nest...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|...Only one way to find out!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hm...}}

*''Not exactly dripping with emotion, is he...?''
*''Wedding photos?''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Not exactly dripping with emotion, is he...?
|Ah...? Is he trying to say that we got married without their blessing?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|This is passive aggressive... but not protest. So there's that.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Wedding photos?
|Yeah, back home when you get a marriage license, they want you to put a photo of the couple on the registration.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|He comes off as harsh, but this is just his way of showing he cares. He never let me do anything the "wrong way," so registering for a Tallsky marriage license is... kind of his blessing, in not so many words.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|And I think, on some level, he never really got over me leaving to come out here by myself... He's actually quite the softie deep down.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|''Pet Name'', would you mind taking some more wedding photos to send to Tallsky for a marriage license? It might even be... y'know... fun!}}

*''Yes, we need to put Grandpa's mind at ease.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''I hardly need an excuse for a photo shoot!'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Alright!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Here's one thing we can do to show we're serious... There's a tradition that the higher you hold your wedding, the more luck will follow! So...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Why don't we take some photos at the top of Grand Mesa? That place is pretty high up, even by Tallsky standards!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|That settles the location. What else...?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Maybe we should build something? Set the scene a little bit?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|''Pet Name'', any thoughts?}}

*''Let's prepare some "Builder cruise" props.''
*''It should be something that best represents us.''
*''Er... maybe nature is the best set piece...''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Let's prepare some "Builder cruise" props.
|Haha... go around fixing things at Grand Mesa? I'm not sure there's anything up there we can fix...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|That does give me another idea, though...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=It should be something that best represents us.
|Something that best represents us...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Er... maybe nature is the best set piece...
|Oh, come on! Let's show them how much we've improved as Builders since we met!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Why don't I build something for you and you build something for me? It can be a surprise!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|As a matter of fact... I think I know just the thing for you! Let me know when you're ready, ''Pet Name'', then I'll set up the photo shoot!}}
The conversation ends.
