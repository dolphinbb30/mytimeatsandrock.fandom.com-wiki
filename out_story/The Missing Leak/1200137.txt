{{dialogue|Trudy|We were just discussing... a particular sample. Let me just get them caught up for a moment?}}

*''Sure, catch me up.''
*''Let's skip science class, what do you need?''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Sure, catch me up.
|Well, Zeke and I have been trying different soil types out in the Eufaula to see if we can get plants to grow in that environment, to no avail so far, I might add.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|As I was coming home from this last expedition, I stopped at an Old World wreckage to rest my feet. I've never seen this wreckage before, it must have been uncovered by the last sandstorm.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Weird thing was, the place had some type of algae everywhere. I couldn't go deeper, since there was a damaged door that wouldn't budge, but I did manage to gather some algae samples.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Let's skip science class, what do you need?
|Right! We need to get into the Shipwreck Ruins. It's a place that I stopped at to rest my feet on my way back from the last expedition. Weirdly, I saw a lot of algae growing there. I couldn't investigate due to a damaged door.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Point is, Zeke wants to know why the algae can survive in such a tough environment, so we need to go back there to figure it out. For that I'll need your help, Builders. We need to be able to open the broken hydraulic door to get inside!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|What are you looking for in there?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ah, hah... yes, Zeke. Care to elaborate?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Um. Okay. Yeah. This algae sample Trudy brought back has some very strange nutrients in them. I want to see the source.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|I've read before from an Old World book of my Pa's that there were biochemicals used to rejuvenate soil, but I've never figured 'em out. Maybe this is the key to the soil problem we've been trying to solve for the last 30 years.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Um. Do you wanna go explore these ruins with us?}}

*''I'm game!''
*''Um, shouldn't we ask the Civil Corps?''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=I'm game!
|Cool! Count me in, too!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|My, what an adventurous pair of Builders you two are! How lucky we are to have you!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Though, I do have one small request...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Um, shouldn't we ask the Civil Corps?
|Actually, ''Player'', about that... I have a small request...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Can we all keep this under wraps for the time being? Which is to say, not make this Civil Corps business? If this, like, let's say some of my other endeavors, doesn't go quite as planned, I... I just can't handle another event like that Fireside...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Hey. Even if this doesn't work, you're just tryin' your best...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I know... It's just...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|No problem, Mayor. Your secret's safe with us!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Thank you, all. Your support... means a lot to me!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Now, to get through the door, Heidi figured we'll need a {{textcolor|green|Level 3 Pickhammer}}. And since we're not sure what's inside the ruin exactly, I'd like to order a few {{textcolor|green|Protective Suits}} as well.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|reward={{i2|Protective Suit|1}}|If possible, I'd like to go as soon as we can, so I went ahead and got the Protection Suit diagram for you. I assume you can make the Level 3 Pickhammer at your Worktable...?}}

*''Of course, no problem.''
*''It's a bit much...''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Of course, no problem.
|Well, there's four of us, we're going to need four Protective Suits. I think you two can make two each, make it a bit easier for yourselves.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|No problem here either!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=It's a bit much...
|Understood. I know how busy you guys are. Let's just get this done, but not worry too much about timing. You don't have to rush, just relax a little.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Protective Suits... well there's four of us, so we'll need four Protective Suits. ''Player'', how about we make two each? That way it's a teensy bit more manageable.}}
