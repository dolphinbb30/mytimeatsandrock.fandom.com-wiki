Title: Renowned Representative Returns, Rejoice!
After what seems like ages, finally our beloved mayor has rejoined our ranks! 

Mayor Trudy set off into the desert testing new plant samples for Zeke's ongoing research into desert planting. It was dangerous, perhaps some might even say reckless, but whatever you believe, it's hard to argue with results! 

That's right, Trudy has returned safely, what did she find out there in the desert? Find out more at the upcoming Fireside!

When pressed for comment, Mayor Trudy had this to say on the matter: "Oh, Heidi. You don't need to do a news article on me. I'm sure people will just find out on their own if they're interested." Well guess, what? I did it anyway! 

Welcome back, Trudy!
