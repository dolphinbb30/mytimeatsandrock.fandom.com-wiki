{{dialogue|Qi|Heidi, lend me the Mobile Suit for a few days. I need it. For research.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Eh, and what "research" is this, specifically?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Specifically? One: analyze the operative efficiency of the Mobile Suit over various terrains. Two: analyze the feedback efficiency of the suit while testing specific control inputs. Three: synthesize these and other data in order to improve pilotability of the suit.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Alright, I walked into that one... That's on me. So what you're sayin' is: you wanna learn to drive it better?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Framing my research with such terminology diminishes the prestige somewhat, but, yes. One could say that.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Well, doc, I know you love that thing but, ah... let's not forget what happened at the ribbon cutting ceremony. You crashed the suit, and that was a whole lotta hurt!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The injuries I sustained from said accident were minor and have since healed. You needn't concern yourself with-}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I wasn't talking about you! The suit! Thing's all banged up now! Won't even start...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I see. Was this inoperative status of the Mobile Suit caused by my actions?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Well, to be fair, just us using it on the bridge is where most of the wear and tear came from, I think your little fender bender was just the straw that broke the camel's back...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I mean, it looks like the front armor is damaged and the ancillary engine is broken. On top of that, several hydaulic powered joints are beyond stressed. I'd say it needs an overhaul to say the least.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Tell you what: the city's got no plans to use the suit anytime soon. Fix 'er up, keep 'er in tip-top shape, and you can go on your little joyride- er, sorry, do all the "research" you want. Whaddya think about that?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I accept. Although I will, however, need a whole host of rather complex materials to make the repairs. And to say that the Civil Corps could handle such a task would be a rather dubious claim...}}
