|Hmmm... I haven't really thought about that much. I mainly just like to look at things around me, and just ask, "how?" How does that work? How did this happen?}}
{{dialogue|Haru|indent=true|Chemistry is the beauty of change. In a way, it's magic. But a magic we can analyze and understand. Sometimes when things interact, there's no reaction. But sometimes you just put the right stuff together... Poof! You get fireworks.}}
{{dialogue|Haru|indent=true|answer=Lab fire? Seems kind of scary...
|Well, such failure is a part of the process. And safety precautions are always in place to be prepared for the worst. I, of course, was wearing protective gear. The singed paper... Collateral damage I can live with.}}
