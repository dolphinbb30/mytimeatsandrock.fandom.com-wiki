Title: Renowned Representative Returns, Rejoice!
After what seems like ages, finally our beloved mayor has rejoined our ranks! 

Mayor Trudy set off into the desert testing new plant samples for Zeke's ongoing research into desert planting. It was dangerous, perhaps some might even say reckless, but whatever you believe, it's hard to argue with results! 

That's right, Trudy has returned safely, what did she find out there in the desert? Find out more at the upcoming Fireside!

When pressed for comment, Mayor Trudy had this to say on the matter: "Oh, Heidi. You don't need to do a news article on me. I'm sure people will just find out on their own if they're interested." Well guess, what? I did it anyway! 

Welcome back, Trudy!

Title: Biocrust Breakthrough! (Please Read: Not Boring)
Hey! Do not look away from this page! Yes, this is a science article, but trust me, if you live in Sandrock, you're going to want to hear about this!

Sure, perhaps a more pertinent headline might have something to do with the fact that Mayor Trudy may have slightly circumvented certain legal traditions by leading a top secret diving party into an unexplored ruins, but... well, hey, can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs!

For more on this, we interviewed resident omelet enthusiast, Grace of the Blue Moon: "I totally get the point you're trying to make, but I read recently that there were actually Old World devices that would clone chicken egg material, eliminating the need for eggs or... cracking. Bit of a head trip, but cruelty-free, so... yeah good luck picking a side there." Thanks for the insight, Grace! Exactly the pivot I needed for this article!

With that out of the way, let's talk facts. Fact of the matter is, Zeke's biocrust studies have hit a major breakthrough with this latest batch of samples brought in! In a rather miraculous turn of events, said diving party of ambiguous statutory standing uncovered an Old World bio-facility that specialized in experimenting on plants and maybe... on a creepier note, also animals.

Within, our brave and totally forgivable crew found technology related to plant nutrition, and it is the opinion of experts within our community that indeed this technology will be what we need to supercharge desert planting around the oasis and be a big step towards a greener Sandrock!

Title: The Specialist and You: Why This Seemingly Bad Thing is Actually Good
Following the portentous temporary relocation of everyone's favorite church lady, City Hall was pressed to make some changes with the current security arrangement within Sandrock. The decision has been made to hire a specialist, someone to help the Civil Corps find the perpetrator of said portentous pilferage. However, this decision has been met with mixed responses. 

"You know, honestly, me and Unsuur are happy to get the help. Plus a chance to work with a professional; we're not too big to admit we need an expert out here on the case," remarked Sheriff Justice. But others were less optimistic, and in some cases, just confused.

"I mean do we really need a specialist? I think everyone's plenty special already!" said Burgess of the situation, who clearly has a deep misunderstanding of everything that is going on.

"Specialist is just code for bounty hunter. We're bringing in one monster to deal with another; this won't end well," Zeke suggested in a foreboding manner.

So we here at the Tumbleweed Standard decided to do a bit of a deep dive, a little bit of investigative journalism on the subject to put everyone's fears to rest. Or, perhaps to confirm them. But ideally the former.

A concern many people seem to have is that this specialist might be a dangerous person, someone who might put Sandrock in harm's way at the expense of catching his target. We began by reaching out to some other specialists to see what kind of reputation he's garnered for himself. 

First we got in touch with Jerry 'The Foot,' who had this to say: 

"Yeah all us bounty hunters, I mean, oh, yeah you said I should say... specialists, we get cool nicknames. Like me, they call me 'The Foot' cause I always stamp out my enemies! And I kinda smell. But that's a gland problem, I can't really help that and don't like it when people bring it up."

Yeah, anyway, there's Jo Triggerfingers, they call him that cuz he'll fire a weapon at you with any one of his fingers, yeah he holds his iron all sorts of ways, really surprises folk. There's Madhab the Mouth, he's always talkin'. Jengo Two-hands, well, that one don't need explainin', but ah... yeah Bronco the Kid, we always called him that cuz, ah... I mean, yeah he's like a kid. Like got the mental capacity of a child. He thought we were givin' him a cool cowboy name, but nah, we were makin' fun of him. Uh, great guy, though. I do hear he catches criminals. Y'know. Sometimes. 

"Is he dangerous? Nah, not really, I don't think you folks got anything to worry about in that department. I'd just keep your receipt, know what I mean? Just in case."

This interview really put us at ease. Sure, it would be nice to know we were getting someone with a bit more of a reputation for actually catching criminals, but this reporter would argue that it shouldn't be at the expense of bringing a wildcard into town, eh? Can we make these assessments based on just one person's opinion? Well, Jerry 'the Foot' tapped out that whole interview in such colloquial language over the telegraph. How could anyone with such dexterous wordsmithing abilities be wrong?

Title: Costumed Criminal Caught!
"Eat marbles, marble eaters!" Famous last words.

Last words before being caught, that is! Was that enough of a hook? See for a second there, maybe you thought... Oh, alright, maybe that wasn't a great thing to do. Sorry for misleading you, but we put out a survey and apparently more than half of our readers don't make it more than halfway down the page! So, yeah. Just trying to make things more exciting.

Anyway, ''Player'' caught a bandit!

Oh, maybe that was a better hook. But in any case, yes, it's true. Apparently upon receiving a highly dubious commission, ''Player'' hit the streets looking for clues leading to the revelation of the specialist's true identity and subsequent capture! Bravo, ''Player''! 

Our hard-boiled Builder detective had this to say on the matter:

"It all stank to high heaven. I could see trouble written all over his face, and had a feeling he couldn't even spell the word if he was lookin' at it in the mirror. He fancied himself a wolf in sheep's clothing, but when he opened his mouth all I could hear was 'baa baa baa...'"

Or at least, that's what I'd expect to hear. Everyone thinks in metaphors when they're solving crimes! Unfortunately ''Player'' was not available for comment, and, well... Sorry, ''Player''! We have to get this news out while it's still hot!

Andy, the bandit boy is safely in the hands of the Civil Corps, and it is planned that he will be sent to work for the Church until he can be rehabilitated.

We eagerly await the arrival of the real specialist. Stay tuned to the Tumbleweed Standard for more updates on these situations. Are you still reading? Yay! Article's over now, thanks for reading!

Title: Getting to Know Bronco the Kid: How a Seemingly Bad Thing was not Actually a Good Thing and was, as it Initially Seemed, a Bad Thing
Following up on our previous article: "The Specialist and You: How a Seemingly Bad Thing is Actually a Good Thing;" now that said specialist has actually arrived, let's look at the ongoing situation and how it might be affecting you, the reader. Are things as bad as they seem? Short answer, "yes."

First off, let's hear it from the man in his own words... Who is Bronco the Kid?

"I am the law," he began. He stood there for a good thirty seconds or so squinting at me and protruding his jaw slightly. Once it was clear he was not going to elaborate, I decided to go for a follow up. "What do you... mean by that exactly?" I asked.

"I am the night. I am darkness. I the one who answers the call... Whenever a little old lady needs help crossing the street, I'll be there. Whenever candy is taken from a baby, I'll be there. Whenever the ice cream machine at a late night diner is very suspiciously said to be broken when it looks totally fine, I'll be there, too!"

No doubt you too have been victim to one of Bronco's numerous inane and unnecessarily invasive traffic stops, as well as heard similar speeches that also go nowhere and are just oozing with delusions of grandeur. Due to multiple complaints, as of this writing, Bronco's authority to detain citizens will shortly be revoked which... should really come as no surprise to anyone.

Bronco's contract includes a clause that promises he will 'capture his target or die trying,' so... expect to see a lot more of him. But do feel free to report him to City Hall if he's acting up again.

Title: Important Investor's Impending Inspection
For those of you who haven't heard, esteemed and world famous business mogul, Musa, plans to visit Sandrock to talk business with Mayor Trudy! If all goes well, we hope to secure funding for a road to Portia, which, as many of you know, will allow Sandrock to ship in water much more easily! And who doesn't like water?

So, everyone mark your calendars and plan accordingly! Mayor Trudy and I will be in discussions with Musa to organize a meet and greet sometime after an initial meeting at City Hall. 

This reporter recommends that if you want anything signed, prepare it in advance. Remember that autographs written on body parts do wash off, so really consider getting an object of some sort signed. 

Be aware of personal space, don't try to touch Musa or shake his hand unless he offers first. If you have something you want to say, avoid gushy statements like "omigoshiloveyoumusa!" Go with something he would want to be known for like, "The way you helped out with the Lucien refugees, that was all class."

Title: I Believe in Sandrock!
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... wait, got that mixed up; it was the worst of times, and then... the best of times!

That seems as good a way as any to describe the events that unfolded recently at the Blue Moon as Musa made his way into what turned out to be a very unwelcoming welcome party. Now, this reporter doesn't really feel the need to dwell on facts such as "who exploded what" or "what ignited whom," but rather, let us focus on the result!

After a rather dismal first act, it looked like we'd ruined our chances to impress Musa, that is until... the tables turned! And were set on fire! And promptly extinguished. It was an extinguishing... of hope!

Mort shared with us all the most moving of tales... one of loss, one of regret, but ultimately, a tale of inspiration. He spoke solemnly, gaze aligned squarely at our wealthy guest, tears forming in his eyes... 

"I believe in these people. I believe in Sandrock." 

Powerful words. So much so that even the calculating businessman, infamous for his heart of stone in the negotiation room, had no choice but to reconsider his refusal to invest in our town. 

Regardless of Musa's ultimate decision, this reporter is thoughtlessly jumping on the bandwagon. I believe in Sandrock, too!

Title: Green Gas Gunks up Gorge
Gas in your canyon? It's more likely than you think.

Following an incident at the Blue Moon that we shall never speak of again, more bad news struck just the following day.

We all know the Valley of Whispers: that quaint, funny little canyon oozing with toxic chemicals. What could go wrong, right? Well, as it turns out, all of that toxic ooze is in fact, bad.

And it's really ramped up recently! Before we were pretty "live and let live" with the ooze, just staying out of its way, allowing it to ooze peacefully oozily in its little ooze-zone, but as of just recently, a lot of the gas has been floating out of the canyon and infecting citizens and critter alike!

Note that the symptoms resulting from gas exposure are extremely mild, though long-term effects are still unknown so... Probably best to avoid the gas whenever possible. I mean, have you ever heard anyone say, "Dang, I really regret not inhaling more toxic chemicals?" So yeah, even if effects are mild, probably better to just... not.

Nevertheless, our brave Civil Corps is on the case! With ''Player'' taking the lead, our Corps plans to head down to the canyon as soon as possible and find out what the darn dealio is already!

That green gas has got to go!

Once again, ''Player'' has led a successful dive into a new ruins! Well. Let's call them outdoor ruins? Eh, whatever the case, ''Player'' cleaned all the gunk out of the Valley of Whispers! Which has led to a sharp decline in incidents of what Sandrock doctors have labelled "Green-itis." It is expected that Green-itis will be soon completely eradicated.

Impressed with with our ability to greenify and also... de-greenify where need be, Musa has decided to pull the trigger on our road deal! This road to Portia will be one of the most important undertakings in recent Sandrock history, and it marks a turning point in our future as well. Yes, folks, there has never been a better time to believe in Sandrock than right now. Investors take note!

Musa has said that he does intend to stick around as we begin the project, which is nice. I mean. Isn't he the CEO of like five companies? Seems a little odd that he can just take a bunch of time off to watch us pass his little tests or whatever, but who am I to criticize?

Title: Verdict Invalidated, Veritable Villain Revealed!
"Where. Is. Logan!?"

The unhinged water thief shouted out to the crowd, a vein bulging in his neck as he stared down resident superstar Builder, ''Player'' in an accusative fervor.

"Lookin' for me?" former hero turned bandit turned hero again, Logan, cooly called out from the crowd.

The authorities immediately collapsed on him, but to no avail! In a flash, Logan was off his feet, tumbling towards the Statue of Peach that adorns the center island of Martle's Oasis.

Then, in a shock to all at the scene, Logan tore down the statue, revealing a network of piping that has been regulating the oasis water level for years!

The so called "water crisis" was a scam all along...

Filled with embarassment, rage, and shame, Pastor Miguel took aim at Logan with a handgun and pulled the trigger! Only to be stopped by none other than Minister Matilda! 

In the shuffle, Matilda sustained injuries, but the Sandrock Clinic has confidently reported that she will recover soon.

As Pastor Miguel, cornered by a crowd of enraged and betrayed Sandrockers, attempted to make his escape, yet another villain tore off his proverbial mask and attacked the town on Miguel's behalf...!

Pen! Bellowing as he brandished his relic weapon, attempting to secure an escape route for our already infamous water thief, he lept into the air and aimed his cannon squarely at the mayor of Sandrock! 

"Mrs. Mayor, noooooooo!" screamed sheriff Justice as he jumped through the air in slow motion to absorb the blow meant to land behind him.

A shot rings out on the air. The sound of a body hitting the ground. Dust flies through the air...

And Justice brings himself to his feet, unscathed...! 

Pen's relic weapon lets out a pathetic sigh... only soot and smoke leaks out of its opening...

"Lookin' for this?" says Andy, rolling out the fifth twist for the scene: Pen's relic weapon was sabotaged at some point off camera! Then the man in the back said, "Everyone, attack," and it turned into a town square blitz! It was electric! So frantically hectic! And then ''Player'' punched Pen in the face and knocked him out.

But wait, there's more! Still implicated in the conspiracy to corrupt Sandrock was none other than Commissioner Yan of the commerce guild! Long story short: somebody finally legally punched him in the mouth.

Sandrock is saved!  

Details of the criminals' arrest and motive will remain classified information until the Civil Corps is ready to release a report.

"They're bad guys. We got 'em. What more do you really need to know?" 

- Justice

{{dialogue|Andy|Oh, those Duvos nobodies... just lemme at 'em! I'll murdalize 'em! I'll turn 'em in to mincemeat! I'll... Well, maybe I'll just take a page out of Haru's book and throw stuff at 'em from a distance... Never can be too safe when it comes to battlin'.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Okay, so Duvos is coming. We're still pitching plans, right? Here's mine: We bury Sandrock. Yeah! We bury the whole town in sand, leave, and then come back when they're gone! I call it, "Operation: Sandberry!" Eh? Eh? Come on, everyone needs a little humor right now.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Hey, before all this goes down with Duvos, don't be a stranger at my shop. The right tool for the job can mean the difference between life or death... and not just for yourself...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Duvos... they're even worse than it said in my history book. This is what happens to people if they never get any sun, I guess...}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Duvos has troops along the railways, ready to ambush us... I'm thinkin' I might drive one into 'em anyway, ''Player''! Like a train bat out of heck!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Don't worry, ''Player''. I've already calculated the odds of our survival. I'd best not share them with you, as hearing the odds may lull you into a false sense of security and affect your performance on the turret. But let me put it to you this way: I have not fled town yet.}}

Title: The Church Dungeon and You: An Investigative Report
A lot has been going on lately with all the conspiracies being unravelled, conspirators being imprisoned, and, well, with all the political shiftings going on, I'd like to take a little bit of time to talk about... the boring stuff.

That's right, everyone's talking about who's betrayed whom and who's been spying on what, but there are still some people who want to know what happened behind the scenes. How were they hiding water? Why were they hiding water? What else was going on in that weird basement of theirs, anyway?

These questions and more will be answered here in this article!

The motive of our criminals was simple: they wanted to destroy our town! Kind of a bad look, if you ask me. Anyway, on to the basement dungeon. 

Having discovered the location of the secret ruin under the church, the Civil Corps went in with forensics to see what clues they might be able to uncover. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Are we really sure they were just hiding water? Basement dungeons are usually far more sinister than that." And the answer is, "Yes. Really. Just regular crimes. Not a murder dungeon. Not a... anything-worse-than-that dungeon either."

The Civil Corps went in expecting to find weird freaky stuff: bloody tools, science experiments gone wrong, handcuffs, some kind of cultish shrine, but... nope. None of that.

"Aside from the water stealin' machine, all we found was a bunch of searchlights... which I thought was odd, because... well, if no one is manning the searchlights, what's the point of having them? I mean, they'd need to have people there monitoring each of those rooms for the searchlights 24/7 to be of any use, but it was just Yan, Pen, and Miguel in on the whole thing, and they were never there, and I mean, the rooms in there aren't even that dark, either?" Sheriff Justice of the Civil Corps had to say on the matter.

{{dialogue|Andy|I knew Logan would save us! Oh, er, and... you, too, ''Player''! Y'all make quite the team! Keep up the good work and maybe you can be third in command in our gang! After me and Logan, of course.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|I offered the soldiers keeping me captive a discount at my store to let me go, but they resisted. Luckily, you went with a more direct approach and... saved the entire town!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Did you see what those soldiers did to our oasis? No, no... better not to tell me. I'll just... fish all the gunk out, decontaminate it with the best our city has to offer, then have Dan-bi bonk me in the head until I can't remember any of this. It'll be super!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|In a pinch, Golden Goose tokens make for fine shrapnel. I can tell you from experience, heh heh heh.... Oh, and nice work, ''Player''. We wouldn't have won this without you.}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Yeeeehaw! Sandrock will rise again! We've won the war of Duvosian aggression! Sent 'em back over the hills with their tails between their legs...! Now get up on that duck and go finish the job, ''Player''. Show them no mercy! Kick 'em once or twice for me!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|A-are you sure you don't want to wait for Ri-ri to return with the Alliance army before you go over to fight that airship? H-he could be back any minute, you know...! And... also, if you run into the Minis- Matilda, maybe don't hurt her... too much? I still can't force myself to see her as a complete enemy even after her betrayal...}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Mehhh, Elsie, why'd you go an' spend all that time runnin' around in the desert lookin' for a mythical duck that don't exiiiist... Hah! Who's quacking n-! I mean, who's laughing now!?}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|We seem to be entering the final chapters of our battle against Duvos... Please, ''Player'', be careful. I want you to be around for the epilogue... And ideally, a sequel...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|You are... putting yourself in danger. Whatever happens... you must return.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|You played those Duvos crooks like a fiddle, ''Player''. Well done. Oh yeah, and also there was the part where we kicked their butts. Ten out of ten there as well. But let's not celebrate yet. Still one more thing to do...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Elsie's basket diagram looks good to me. Well. It is just a drawing of a basket. I might have added a few details... related to... materials, measurements, tensile calculations, ergonomics, weight capacity... You know. The little extras. Should be good to go!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Whew. Finally, Duvos is out of here. I mean, I never thought it was gonna be easy but... that wasn't easy.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|''Player''! You saved my Ma! You saved all of us! Okay. It's official. I'm putting my dreams of being an astronaut aside; Builder is the clear choice from here on out!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Well. I ended up not really being able to help out much. I'll just have to spread the tale of your bravery on the train intercom once we're operational again!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|You were somethin' else back there, ''Player''! You saved... well, pretty much everybody! And, once you got the rest of the Civil Corps out, well... it was all downhill from there! Er... uphill to the Temple... Ah, you get the idea!}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Bet those Duvos clowns are gonna think twice after gettin' their butts handed to 'em like that! You come to Sandrock, you better come to play!}}

{{dialogue|Logan|Were you ever worried? Hurry up and build that basket, let's go round two with those sons of Yakmels! I'm itchin' to finish the fight...}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Even though Matilda betrayed us, I still trust everyone else in town. If I no longer trust my own people, then Duvos has already won.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Duvos tried to recruit you? Hah! What a bunch of spuds. I mean, even if we wanted to join them, we signed a contract!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|What, you've come to gloat? I should thank you as well, for removing such an irritating presence...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Leave me, ''Player''. I have a lot to think about...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|They tried to control us with fear... but we are fearless. Your bravery will surely be remembered for years to come, ''Player''. I'm... proud to know you.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|I can't believe Matilda betrayed us all... she was such a normal person that we never questioned her motives on anything. She really played us.}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Rumor has it that commander fellow had a thing for you, is that true? So when you kicked his butt, was it satisfying? Or just kinda sad...?}}

{{dialogue|Qi|The hardest part is over. Er, for me. The hardest part for me was staying calm during that awful, awful battle. The hardest part for you, I assume, will be attacking that airship. Good luck. Oh, and do be on the look out for space relics while you're over there.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|That whole occupation thing was less than ideal, but, hey, at least somebody got to sock that Yan another one! Heh, heh... I've been... tryin' to look more on the bright side lately...}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Thanks for saving me back there, ''Player''! They mess with one of us, they mess with all of us! Er, well... I guess in this case... they were messing with all of us from the get go. In any case, thanks again!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Like I said, it's almost always the person you most suspect. Almost. This time, of course, it was the person you'd least suspect, Matilda. We played the odds and lost.}}

{{dialogue|Venti|Can we use those duck baskets in the mines? Hmmm maybe I need to talk to Rocky...}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|You know, I've always had a way with troublemakers, I help turn things around, but... that Matilda? Tch, tch, tch... That woman needs the Light! The real Light, not whatever phoney version she's been preachin' all this time...}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Grrrr... 'Course I bet against you losers! They had a whole army! An army's got to beat out some yokel militia ninety-nine times out of a hundred! How am I always so unlucky...?}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Sorry I wasn't much help in liberating the town. They had me tied up and watched over by two Duvos soldiers. Still, I am ashamed.}}
