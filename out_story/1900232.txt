{{dialogue|Owen|...As the proprietor of Sandrock's only saloon, my Blue Moon has hundreds of guests come through regularly. I have a little trick to help me remember 'em all. Fang, you have a lot of patients, do you remember 'em all?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Yes.}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Pulse.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Pulse? What's that? Like, a heartbeat?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Not just pulse. Symptoms vary...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Hey, you hear that, ''Player''? Our doctor's skills sure are amazing, eh? He can tell the difference between patients based on their heart rate or somethin'! So what do you two think, what's my trick for remembering customers?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Mm... Don't know...}}

*''The guest's appearance.''
*''The guest's personalities.''
*''The guest's wallet.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The guest's appearance.
|I mean, you're not way off. But I reckon it'd be hard to remember all of 'em that way. My trick is to connect and get to know them. It's easier to remember people when you got an idea of what they're like.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The guest's personalities.
|reward={{NPC2|Owen|rp=2}}|Exactly!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The guest's wallet.
|Ah? C'mon, y'all! You know that ain't me! As the owner here, it's of course impossible not to pay attention to the... uh... financial situation of the guests. But when it comes to making friends, last place I look is at their wallet!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Hahah, you know that reminds me of a crazy story. Once, a guest came and his wallet was shaped like this little frog. When he arrived, it was a fat old thing. When he left, well that frog had turned back to a tadpole it was that skinny!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|But, uh, anyway. Nah, I get to know my customers personally, that's how I never forget 'em!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Compared to people's appearances, someone's character is always unique. But it takes time, it's not a fast process. That's why I love making friends with my guests. Just chatting all night, the hours fly by!}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Sounds... tiring.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Tiring! Ha! Why would it be tiring? Even if I get tired, honestly, I just enjoy it so much it's not even worth mentioning.}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Enjoy? Hard to... imagine...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Yeah, you should try. Once you give it a shot, you'll know it's worth it. Trust me.}}
The conversation ends.
