Title: Verdict Invalidated, Veritable Villain Revealed!
"Where. Is. Logan!?"

The unhinged water thief shouted out to the crowd, a vein bulging in his neck as he stared down resident superstar Builder, ''Player'' in an accusative fervor.

"Lookin' for me?" former hero turned bandit turned hero again, Logan, cooly called out from the crowd.

The authorities immediately collapsed on him, but to no avail! In a flash, Logan was off his feet, tumbling towards the Statue of Peach that adorns the center island of Martle's Oasis.

Then, in a shock to all at the scene, Logan tore down the statue, revealing a network of piping that has been regulating the oasis water level for years!

The so called "water crisis" was a scam all along...

Filled with embarassment, rage, and shame, Pastor Miguel took aim at Logan with a handgun and pulled the trigger! Only to be stopped by none other than Minister Matilda! 

In the shuffle, Matilda sustained injuries, but the Sandrock Clinic has confidently reported that she will recover soon.

As Pastor Miguel, cornered by a crowd of enraged and betrayed Sandrockers, attempted to make his escape, yet another villain tore off his proverbial mask and attacked the town on Miguel's behalf...!

Pen! Bellowing as he brandished his relic weapon, attempting to secure an escape route for our already infamous water thief, he lept into the air and aimed his cannon squarely at the mayor of Sandrock! 

"Mrs. Mayor, noooooooo!" screamed sheriff Justice as he jumped through the air in slow motion to absorb the blow meant to land behind him.

A shot rings out on the air. The sound of a body hitting the ground. Dust flies through the air...

And Justice brings himself to his feet, unscathed...! 

Pen's relic weapon lets out a pathetic sigh... only soot and smoke leaks out of its opening...

"Lookin' for this?" says Andy, rolling out the fifth twist for the scene: Pen's relic weapon was sabotaged at some point off camera! Then the man in the back said, "Everyone, attack," and it turned into a town square blitz! It was electric! So frantically hectic! And then ''Player'' punched Pen in the face and knocked him out.

But wait, there's more! Still implicated in the conspiracy to corrupt Sandrock was none other than Commissioner Yan of the commerce guild! Long story short: somebody finally legally punched him in the mouth.

Sandrock is saved!  

Details of the criminals' arrest and motive will remain classified information until the Civil Corps is ready to release a report.

"They're bad guys. We got 'em. What more do you really need to know?" 

- Justice

{{dialogue|Trudy|''Player''! There you are... We were just listening to Grace and Logan. I'm still trying to process everything.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Quite the adventure you've had, huh?}}

*''All in a day's work.''
*''Things really escalated quickly.''
*''Sandrock: one. Duvos: zero.''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=All in a day's work.
|Hah! I typed up that help wanted ad myself, and I'm pretty sure I don't remember putting espionage as one of the required skill sets...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Things really escalated quickly.
|They did. One day I'm taking a look at diagrams for the tunnel, next thing I know our town's a 9 AM warzone!}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Sandrock: one. Duvos: zero.
|Ah, you're keeping track as well, I see.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|''Player'' handled themselves very well. I wish I'd gotten into contact with you sooner.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Right... might I interject with a bit of questioning? So you're with Alliance Central Intelligence?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Yep, they sent me in after we intercepted some telegraph activity from here to Duvos that kicked this whole thing off.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|And Logan knew about this as well? How did that happen?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Duvos. The last thing my Pa ever said to me.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|In any case, Trudy, as you mentioned, the first thing you wanted to do is contact the Alliance. Totally get that. Understandable. But how about instead... not doing that.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I... beg your pardon?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|We really got the drop on this operation; Duvos has no idea two of their plants just got made. You sending a telegram to the council will tip them off.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|So you've got a window...}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Bingo.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|They have been sending encoded telegrams from Sandrock to Duvos all this time under the name "Tiger."}}
{{dialogue|Grace|All we need is for the Duvos criminals to tell us how they're getting orders and {{textcolor|green|we'll act as "Tiger" to make contact with their HQ}}. Might become the biggest intel triumph since the last war!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Don't reckon they'll freely hand over such information...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Ahem... Justice, as you yourself may recall, I can be quite persuasive...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|You did... convinced me to start lettin' you in to the ruins...}}

|Sure you were, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Impressive track record, Grace. Well. Go ahead then... I trust your judgement.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Thank you, Madam Mayor.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Ah. Right. And don't worry about security. I've already contacted HQ and got a crew coming in to take the criminals off your hands. We'll keep a close eye on them until then, right, Justice?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I'm not lettin' 'em out of my sight.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Good. ''Player'', as of late, I've really become quite the fan of your work. Would you mind joining me as I pay our Duvosian friends a visit {{textcolor|green|tomorrow}}?}}

*''I'll try to help.''
*''I'll make 'em sing.''
*''Eh, you can handle it...''
*''Don't want to go yet?''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|So... What are you gonna do Logan? You... uh, still broke some laws back there, even for a good reason...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Well, I'm gonna head back to my place 'til you're ready to charge me, Sheriff. I don't think I want to face the citizens until I face the consequences.}}
