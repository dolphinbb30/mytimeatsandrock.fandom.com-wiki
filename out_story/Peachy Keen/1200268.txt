{{dialogue|Burgess|Look who it is, everyone's favorite Mayor architect duo! What brings you to our neck of the woods? Say, have you seen what ''Player'' did with the statue? Pretty ace if I do say so myself!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|That looks so well done, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Fine work indeed! I daresay our Peach looks as young as the day... he... er...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|The day he was immortalized for this particular image that we seem to use for all the Peach statues?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Yeah!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Hm... well, I hate to dampen anyone's spirits, but I'm afraid we have some less than stellar news to report...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Oh, no!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Don't worry, it's not the end of the world!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We've been down to check the oasis water source, done some measurements... {{textcolor|green|We thought the water thieves were really straddling that relic}}, but... well, have you noticed the water level going up lately, Burgess?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Our oasis water comes from a relic? What?!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Indeed, this is sour news! I'll need some time to reflect on the ramifications of such a revelation! The sacred water I hold so near and dear to my heart comes from Age of Corruption technology...!?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Ooh. Right. Forgot that might be something that would bother you. That wasn't even the bad news...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Wasn't even the bad news!?}}

*''He's been through a lot lately...''
*''What's the bad news?''

{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=He's been through a lot lately...
|I have... I really have...!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|I-it's okay...! Thanks, ''Player'', I can take it! Wh-what's the bad news!?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Er, we can come back later...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|No, no... let's just rip the bandage off...!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Al-Alright... we didn't actually find the machine that generates the oasis water, it's somewhere deeper underground; but even when we turned on the flow of water into the oasis to the maximum, the water level isn't going up...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We think {{textcolor|green|the relic is on its last leg...}} We're going to have Qi take a look at it but... for now, we're going to need to keep the water conservation policy... same as it ever was.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Same as it ever was?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Same as it ever was.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Don't you all worry about me. I'll keep doing my best. Just like I know you will, too!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Thank you Pastor Burgess. I'm glad we ran into you, too, ''Player''. We'll update you on the status of the underground water machine when we can. Stay strong, everyone... The {{textcolor|green|Portia road}} will be done soon.}}
