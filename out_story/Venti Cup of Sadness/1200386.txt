{{dialogue|Venti|...Sigh... Oh, pile of rubber scrap, how could I let down Boss Rocky like this? He must be so disappointed in me...}}
{{dialogue|Venti|It's all my fault. The situation became so awkward, and now my friend, ''Player'', probably hates me, too...}}

*''(Go talk to her)''
*{{flirt}}''(Go comfort her)''
*''(Quietly back away)'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|answer=(Go comfort her)
|I shouldn't have fallen for... What a fool you are, Venti. That person is the most popular in Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|Venti, you've always known to only chase those who are unattainable, so that when you can't get them, you confirm your own beliefs that you're not good enough. Why couldn't you control yourself this time? What's wrong with you?}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|I lost my job now, and that person I like probably hates me too. It looks like I'll return to being the Venti with nothing from my childhood...}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|Maybe I should just go back. Back to Baja's junkyard, back to that trash can, the extra-large one that can fit my Venti cup of sadness... sob...}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Oh, ''Player'', it's you... what brings you here?}}
{{dialogue|Venti|I'm sorry for dragging you into trouble last time. I should have told Boss Rocky earlier. Because of me, he almost thought you were stealing, too.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|I just wanted to get closer to you, thought that Boss Rocky wouldn't notice... Bringing you to dig up scrap, it's like what Grande and I used to do, sneaking into Baja's many junkyards to find food...}}
{{dialogue|Venti|I'm sorry...}}

*''It's fine. I'm not mad.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''I think your heart was in the right place.'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Venti|Well, thank you for saying that... ''Player'', you're really kind!}}
{{dialogue|Venti|I think I was just feeling down. Everything was so embarrassing; I feel like I'll remember that moment of getting caught every night before I go to sleep for decades...}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Thank you so much for coming to comfort me. It's okay, though. I'm still optimistic Venti. I've written a report reflecting on my mistakes, and Boss Rocky is willing to accept my apology. Starting tomorrow, I can go back to work again!}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Oh dear, look at me crying over spilled mysterious liquid like a child. Anyway, ''Player'', thank you so much for being there for me. Let's get back to work now! Bye!}}
