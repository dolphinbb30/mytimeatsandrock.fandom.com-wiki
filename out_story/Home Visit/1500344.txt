{{dialogue|Jane|Ah, ''Player''! Just the person I was looking for!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I've been experimenting with different ways of bringing theater to the classroom, and the students have been surprisingly receptive to it! It's really helped them dive into the topic, and really look for meaning.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|So I thought I'd organize a sort of "Model Free Cities" activity. It's kind of a way to get them to understand how politics works, as well as a way to get them to understand and empathize with local issues! I mean, these little guys are the future, right?}}
{{dialogue|Jane|So my idea is that everyone will play the role as "mayor" and have a little election; giving their opinions on Sandrock's future! What do you think?}}

*''Wow that's a great idea!''
*''That's a cool idea. I want to join in!''
*''Won't it be a little difficult for the kids?''

{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=Wow that's a great idea!
|reward={{NPC2|Jane|rp=5}}|Oh, stop it! You're making me embarrassed... I'd like to thank my Ma, and my Pa... and all the people who helped me along the way... haha! But really, thank you.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=That's a cool idea. I want to join in!
|Haha well when we get started I'll find a role for you!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=Won't it be a little difficult for the kids?
|That's a good point... but hey, I say the kids in Sandrock are the brightest of the bright! Jasmine's one of the most clever little girls I've ever met, and Andy learned an incredible amount from Haru, who I hear was a bit of a prodigy himself!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|Even Pebbles is already learning so quickly! And the power in that kid...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Right, for now I need to do a few home visits to the parents, see if they want to take part and see quite how amazing their children are. Oh, I also want to see if the children have their own ideas too. I'm trying to make sure they're all involved!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Hey, here's an idea... how about you join me? You're like the most popular person in town! With your help, I think people would welcome the idea with open arms!}}

*''Count me in!''
*''Phew, I'm looking at my plate, and it's pretty full...''

{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=Count me in!
|Let's head to Logan and Andy's first. I already asked Trudy and Jasmine on the way here, and I'm thrilled to say they're on board!}}
{{dialogue|-2|indent=true|answer=Phew, I'm looking at my plate, and it's pretty full...
|No worries, I can wait until you've got a bit of time on your hands. Let me know if your schedule opens up!}}
