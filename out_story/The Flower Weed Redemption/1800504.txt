{{dialogue|Miguel|Greetings, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|In light of Sandrock undergoing wonderful changes, Burgess and I thought it fitting to replant the Temple flowerbeds.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I am gathering donated flowers from the residents around town. Mi-an and Nia have given us a beautiful matching pair of seedlings, Zeke was kind enough to part with a blossom, and Dan-bi was, as usual, rather enthusiastic to help.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I was wondering whether you would be so gracious as to grow some flowers for us? It would make a fine addition to our community garden.}}

If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Burgess|He said we came up with the idea together? Hehe, oh that Miguel. He came to me asking if it was alright! He wanted to do something nice to bring people together. Brings a tear to my eye...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|"He pushed through his darkest despair, and saw the glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. After the divisions he had caused, with poetic justice he did a final act... to bring people together." I thought it rather beautiful that Miguel wanted to make a garden, so Pablo and I donated a few flowers, too.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|It's hard for me to look at Miguel the same way, but trying to bring everyone together for a garden is a really nice gesture. I got Grandma to help me pick some flowers to give him, too.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Miguel's alright. I sure know what it's like to have people you trusted thinkin' you've lost your mind. Plus... guy like that. He's devout. Fights like hell. If he wants to be on our side, we'd be fools turnin'm away.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|The Temple's new community garden is beautiful... I've never seen Miguel so dedicated to helping the town! People really can change...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|The garden came together rather nicely. After we planted yours, a few more people came forward with donations. It is rather touching.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Miguel really loved the flowers we gave him. I heard that he was a spy for Duvos or something, though? But I guess he's changed now...? Phew, Sandrock's really a rollercoaster.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Yeah, I heard about Miguel's Community Garden. It's a really nice idea. Y'know, I really believe people can change, and I think it's important to forgive. But forgiving doesn't mean the pain doesn't still exist. And that's okay, life's full of little contradictions.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I can't help but feel conflicted... the garden is a lovely idea, and he's been working so hard, but... I trusted Miguel. With everything. And he abused that trust. I know he was tricked... but does that mean I'm supposed to just act like nothing ever happened?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Miguel came and asked for help with the Community Garden. I thought it was a really nice idea. It feels good to get everyone together for something like that.}}
