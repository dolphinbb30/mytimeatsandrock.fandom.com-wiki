{{dialogue|X|Sauce! Sauce! Put the sauce in first, dear!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Look, X, I tried already to make your dish. At By the Stairs, I offer hot deals, not hot meals!}}
{{dialogue|X|No! No! Make it like Ma used to!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey! I followed the recipe, what more do you want? Well, except for the Spicy Bean Paste... we don't have that in Sandrock. So I just made a substitute with what was available, as is the Barnarock way!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Of course, having never tasted Seesaian Spicy Bean Paste, I had to guess. So I substituted pepper for "spicy," beans for "bean," and... toothpaste for "paste!" Ah, yes, the sweet odor reminds me of my childhood...}}
{{dialogue|X|Bleh! Gross! Ew! No! Spicy! Goodness, it's so hot, I'm sweatin' over here! More spice!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah? Really? But I added extra pepper! It's still not spicy enough for Fang? How fine it is to have a good friend with such different tastes! A good friend who never talks to me even though we see each other on a regular basis...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|In any case, we don't have the Spicy Bean Paste! The only person who might have it would be the Mysterious Man! But it seems like he only comes around when he feels like it, how am I going to find him?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Well, though I would adore for Fang to be able to partake of my gourmet cooking, for now, I must bow out. For his beloved Mapo Tofu, I'm afraid he's just going to have to tough it out; or learn to enjoy it: Arvio Style!}}
{{dialogue|X|Bleurgh...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Well... if that doesn't suit you X, then you go find the Mysterious Man yourself. Maybe he can help you, he's got channels I couldnt' dream of. He isn't all powerful though, there's even some things he doesn't have, but I do.}}
{{dialogue|X|You're a bad birdie! Squark!}}
The conversation ends.
{{dialogue|X|What is it, honey?}}

*''I want to help.''
