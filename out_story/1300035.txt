{{dialogue|Matilda|Indeed, we aim not to mourn the absence of those since passed, but rather to honor their memory and look forward to the future...}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Like most things, we Sandrockers like to do things a little differently around here! Back when Martle had just discovered the oasis, it wasn't that long removed from the Age of Darkness, when people were still cowering underground.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Martle thought to organize a game not unlike hide-and-seek to finally take advantage of the freedom offered by the vastness of the Above.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|She had people hang lanterns all 'cross the forest around the oasis to tell our ancestors, as well as people traveling the desert, that "We're here! And we're doing well!"}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|We'll continue that tradition today. Let our tears and joy resonate across the desert. Let our departed ones know, with one voice, our one message: and that's that we're still here!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Come, let us bow our heads and take a moment of silence: in rememberance of those not with us to celebrate today...}}
