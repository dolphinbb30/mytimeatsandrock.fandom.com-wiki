Title: Getting to Know Bronco the Kid: How a Seemingly Bad Thing was not Actually a Good Thing and was, as it Initially Seemed, a Bad Thing
Following up on our previous article: "The Specialist and You: How a Seemingly Bad Thing is Actually a Good Thing;" now that said specialist has actually arrived, let's look at the ongoing situation and how it might be affecting you, the reader. Are things as bad as they seem? Short answer, "yes."

First off, let's hear it from the man in his own words... Who is Bronco the Kid?

"I am the law," he began. He stood there for a good thirty seconds or so squinting at me and protruding his jaw slightly. Once it was clear he was not going to elaborate, I decided to go for a follow up. "What do you... mean by that exactly?" I asked.

"I am the night. I am darkness. I the one who answers the call... Whenever a little old lady needs help crossing the street, I'll be there. Whenever candy is taken from a baby, I'll be there. Whenever the ice cream machine at a late night diner is very suspiciously said to be broken when it looks totally fine, I'll be there, too!"

No doubt you too have been victim to one of Bronco's numerous inane and unnecessarily invasive traffic stops, as well as heard similar speeches that also go nowhere and are just oozing with delusions of grandeur. Due to multiple complaints, as of this writing, Bronco's authority to detain citizens will shortly be revoked which... should really come as no surprise to anyone.

Bronco's contract includes a clause that promises he will 'capture his target or die trying,' so... expect to see a lot more of him. But do feel free to report him to City Hall if he's acting up again.
