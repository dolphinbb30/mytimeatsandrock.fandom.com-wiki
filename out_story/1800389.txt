{{dialogue|Miguel|You have returned.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I thought a lot about what you said.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Abandoned... Why do you think it is that Matilda and Pen abandoned me?}}

*''They never cared about you.''
*''They never cared about your cause.''
*''They probably have their reasons.''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=They never cared about you.
|It surprises me not that Pen betrayed me. He was sent to observe my actions, and cared not for me, nor I of him.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|But Matilda... I did not know she was a member of Duvos. She was sympathetic to my views while we were studying. She did not agree, per se, but she understood me, listened to me.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|It is clear in retrospect, she was simply observing my conversion... even that being said, why would she abandon me? Perhaps you are right. Perhaps she was never my friend or believed in my cause...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=They never cared about your cause.
|It surprises me not that Pen betrayed me. He was sent to observe my actions, and cared not for me, nor I of him. He was far too narcissistic to truly understand the cause.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|But Matilda... I did not know she was a member of Duvos. She was sympathetic to my views while we were studying. She never agreed with me in those days, but I see now that was an act. A way for her to conceal her true identity.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|It is clear in retrospect, she was simply observing my conversion... but I do not think she had no ideals. I truly believe she was a dedicated follower. But perhaps she was never my friend or believed in my cause...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=They probably have their reasons.
|Perhaps. I doubt Pen has reasons for many of his actions. I never saw him as an ideological type. Too... self possessed. Narcissistic.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|But Matilda... I did not know she was a member of Duvos. She was sympathetic to my views while we were studying. She never agreed with me in those days, but I see now that was an act. A way for her to conceal her true identity.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|It is clear in retrospect, she was simply observing my conversion... I truly believe she was a dedicated follower. But... to abandon a comrade? It feels... odd. But perhaps she was never my friend or believed in my cause...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|When I was in the cell with Pen and Lefu... I listened to their ramblings. Lefu did not seem to hold the same beliefs as I. He wanted more land for his people, but he did not care about the future of the human race.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|In fact... he did not even seem to believe in anything. I tried to share my views with him, to find some common ground, but he was far too concerned with arm wrestling Pen. Sigh... these troops were not the saviors I was expecting.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Matilda... I am still shocked she was in such a position at all.}}

*''Why did Matilda jump in front of the bullet?''
*''It sounds like Duvos isn't all it's cracked up to be.''
*''There's always some knuckleheads like Pen.''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=Why did Matilda jump in front of the bullet?
|I have been pondering this myself. I have some theories, however I do not know her true intentions.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|I believe Matilda is a true tactician. While I was only aware of the water plan, she had designs far above my level. When my plan was foiled by Logan, she needed to maintain her cover, and ensure the town trusted her.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|I suppose her goals were worth a small shot in the shoulder. Risky, but calculated. She could not afford for Pen to let anything slip, or for suspicion to also fall upon her.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|Of course, this is simply an educated guess. I have not spoken with her since my arrest. I really believed we were friends...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=It sounds like Duvos isn't all it's cracked up to be.
|Simply because some soldiers on the ground are... ignorant... does not mean the ideology is tainted. I believe in order. I believe that humans truly need to unite under one flag to protect us from our own destruction.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|I hope Matilda also believed. I do not think someone would do so much if they did not believe.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=There's always some knuckleheads like Pen.
|Haha, quite. I do not expect every soldier on the ground to be a shepherd of the flock.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|That being said, there are still some parts of the plan that give me so much doubt. Why did they conceal their intentions from me? What were they doing in the north?}}

*''The water plan was a cover for the excavation of the ruins.''
*''You were a patsy. They set you up, don't you see?''
*''It must all be part of a bigger plan...''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=The water plan was a cover for the excavation of the ruins.
|So I was... a pawn? I- I was told what I was doing was to protect everyone... that when Duvos eventually took over, they'd protect everyone from the dangers of the past...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|But they were excavating the ruins for these Old World relics. These... weapons of war...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|The irony, heh.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=You were a patsy. They set you up, don't you see?
|I cannot believe that is the case. I was working towards a peaceful future for the world.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|But they were excavating these weapons of war...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=It must all be part of a bigger plan...
|reward={{NPC2|Miguel|rp=1}}|Perhaps. I still have many questions of my own.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Now, if that is all...}}

*''Miguel... why did you try to shoot Logan?''
*''That's all.''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=Miguel... why did you try to shoot Logan?
|...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|That is something that will haunt me. I am no killer.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|I think... while I believed I was doing the right thing... a part of me was still thrilled to be fooling everyone. The desire for triumph got to my head... and when I was found out, hubris caused me to lose my mind.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|A cornered beast will lash out. That is not a justification. At that moment I believed everything I had worked for was falling apart... I saw red, and the next thing I knew I heard the gunshot ring out.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|Every night since I have seen that scene play out in my mind. I seek not forgiveness. There is no such forgiveness. I'll regret this for the rest of my life...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Builder, I have once again been left with much to think about. Thank you, ''Player''. We may not be aligned philosophically, perhaps you even hate me, but I value our conversations.}}
