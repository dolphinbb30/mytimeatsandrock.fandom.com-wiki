{{dialogue|Owen|I've been meaning to catch up with you since you moved in, but I guess you and Mi-an have been busy with all that's been going on as of late, haha! As a small token of my appreciation, I'd like to offer you some food and drinks, on the house!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|To a newcomer, Sandrock can be a bit overwhelming, but lucky for you, this old barkeep has been around for just a hair longer than a panbat's age! Perhaps I can shed some light on any subjects you're still unfamiliar with.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|What would you like to know about?}}

*''The Civil Corps''
*''The Church of the Light''
*''The people in town''
*''The {{textcolor|red|dangers}} around town.''
*''That's all for now.'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The Civil Corps
|Ah, the Civil Corps here are that thin, dusty line that stands between us and the many threats crawling throughout the Eufaula Desert. But they only have 2 Corps members here, plus a cat.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|I'm amazed that they're able to keep up with all the security demand. Of course, Pen from the Church helps out as well.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Now, the one running the Civil Corps is a man named Justice. He and I go way back. He's one of the toughest guys around Sandrock these days, but back when we were kids, he was afraid of his own shadow! Haha, boy, how times do change...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|He's a great guy. And his partner Unsuur is also very reliable. If you ever run into trouble, you can surely count on them to help you out.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The Church of the Light
|The Church of the Light is all about preserving the sense of community and getting rid of dangerous Age of Corruption technology, but... the interesting thing about our chapter, is that Matilda is extremely lenient when it comes to relics and old tech!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|In Sandrock, we're allowed to hold onto some pretty mean stuff... Sometimes they'll even let relic weapons slide! And it's a good thing, too! Life would be much harder out here if we didn't have the means to defend ourselves!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Our chapter is pretty unique in that way, although I heard some chapters near the Peripheries take similar stances. The Church members are always proactive about helping people in and around Sandrock, especially the old folk and the young'ns.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|They've gotten so organized that, as a matter of fact, they actually help handle a lot of administrative type stuff in town. We'd be up a creek with out 'em! Well... creeks have water, don't they...?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The people in town
|Let's see... where to begin? We're a small town, so pretty much everybody knows everybody else. There's Vivi the tailor; Heidi the architect and engineer; Cooper, Mabel and Elsie down at the ranch; Catori and her Game Center; Dr. Fang and his bird.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|There's also Arvio and Amirah, the sibling duo from Barnarock who moved here not that long ago. Arvio is young, but he runs the General Store pretty nicely, all things considered.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Amirah makes ceramics that are top notch! I think she's even starting to gain some recognition from people outside of Sandrock! You can definitely tell Amirah is the older sister.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|She's always the one covering for her brother whenever his youth gets the better of him... What's also amazing is that she never lets her skills get to her head, she's very down to earth and... er- sorry, maybe I'm talking too much haha!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Really, this town is full of nice people! If there's someone you want to get to know better, ask them to {{textcolor|green|hang out}}, make time out of your day to {{textcolor|green|go see 'em}}, and hey, who doesn't like {{textcolor|green|a nice gift}} now and again? I'm sure you'll have plenty of friends in no time!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The {{textcolor|red|dangers}} around town.
|Ah, yes... there is an infamous bandit around here named {{textcolor|red|Logan}}. He used to be a citizen of our town as well; one day he just went crazy and blew up a building. I guess being out here in the desert makes some people lose their minds.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Other than that, you have to watch out for some {{textcolor|red|dangerous animals}} roaming the wilds, like the {{textcolor|red|Geeglers}}. They're mutated lizards who seem bent on causing us trouble for some reason...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Oh, and how could I forget, haha... the {{textcolor|red|sandstorms}}! Our Mayor is out in the desert right now trying to stop the winds from blowing sand over what little greenery we have left.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|You know, it wasn't always like this. A lot of people have left, and I can't really blame 'em. Sandrock might not be the best place for everybody, but there are still people who love this town, and we'll all be stickin' around, for better or for worse!}}
