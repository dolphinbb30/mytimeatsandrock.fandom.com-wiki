{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hey, there, er, co-worker, had a Building proposition for you!}}

*''Just co-worker?''
*''Uh, yeah?''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Just co-worker?
|Oh, well, I mean this is kinda work related so I just thought... Uhm, nevermind! Moving on!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Uh, yeah?
|Am I still supposed to call you 'co-worker?' Am I being too formal? Er, nevermind! Moving on!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Check this thing out! Dug it up the other day. It says "projector" on the box, but on the inside, everything's smashed to pieces. Who's projecting now, eh, box?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|The stuff inside looks like a machine, I was thinkin' maybe we could fix it up! Whatever it used to be, it's got a light source that I'm guessing is connected to this lens... oh shoot, it's not a beam weapon, is it...?}}

*''What else is in the box?''
*''Could be dangerous...''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=What else is in the box?
|Ooh, well, there's a manual! I was in a hurry to show this to you so I haven't read it yet...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Could be dangerous...
|C'mon, the last box I found was fine, and it was way more ominous lookin' than this one! Besides, where's your Builder's sense of scientific curiosity?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Here! I almost forgot, there's a manual that came along with this "projector," let's read it together; I'll bet we can settle whether or not it's a laser pretty quick...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Woah, this manual has everything! It's basically a functional blueprint from the Old World! Fascinating...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Let's see here... "Turn on the projector, aim it at a flat surface, adjust the focal length to enhance the image-" Ah hah! See? Not a laser. "Use at night or in low light to ensure image clarity for a better viewing experience."}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|So, it can "project" some kind of image onto a screen... I wonder what kind of images are inside this thing? Wanna find out? I can go repair this thing if you'll build us a {{textcolor|green|screen}}! Whaddya say?}}

*''Sure! Let's do it.''
*''Kinda busy...''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Sure! Let's do it.
|Cool! There's a diagram for a screen right here in the manual; if only all Old World tech was this easy to figure out, am I right? Here, I'll tear out the page for you. Okay, good luck! Let me know when you're ready for "Project: Project!"}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Kinda busy...
|Er, okay! Well if you get time, let me know. Just thought might be fun making something together... or somethin', but what do I know?}}
