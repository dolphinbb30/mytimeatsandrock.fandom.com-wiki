{{dialogue|Elsie|Y'know, a lot's been goin' on lately, an' I really been thinkin' things over. I can't afford to just slack around town anymore, doin' nothin' and jus' bein' a layabout.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I'm puttin' Logan outta my mind an' all. Talkin' about him all day... well, I reckon people'll think I got a crush on him or somethin'.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|So I figured, gotta start helpin' out my family a bit more around the ranch. Takin' it serious like.}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Do some research and prove it to him.
|Hey, that ain't a bad idea...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|Alright! I'm gonna go look for some information. See if I can dig up some research or somethin' I can shove in my Pa's stupid face...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Talk to him some more, he'll come around.

{{dialogue|Elsie|''Player''! I listened to ya, an' I went to the library an' looked at all them books.}}

*''Did you find any information on milking machines?''
*''Found some comics?''
*''C'mon, you didn't go to the library!''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Did you find any information on milking machines?
|Huh? Milkin' machines? Oh, right! Well, I did see somethin' about that, but it was real tough, loads of long words an' junk. But I found two real cool books!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=Found some comics?
|Uh... well, yeah, but that ain't the point! I didn't just find comics!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=C'mon, you didn't go to the library!
|Hey, I ain't jus' a pretty face y'know! I learned a whole lotta stuff.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Check it out, Howlett wrote these books on monster huntin'! Cool, right?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Look at this one, it's got these real pretty pictures, jus' like your handbook! Talks about how to attract monsters, with bait, an' food an' such. I didn't realize Howlett was this good at drawin'!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|But this one's jus' loads of words... looks like them Church books, super dense, all regulations an' junk. I uh... ain't read much of this one.}}

*''You want to be a monster hunter?''
*''This has nothing to do with milking a Yakmel...''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=You want to be a monster hunter?
|Huh? Hmmm a monster hunter...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=This has nothing to do with milking a Yakmel...
|Ah, well that ain't a problem! I can jus' continue to use my hands.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|It's kinda dug into my head, though... Like, I'm workin', and all I can think of is how to find these monsters! I've been goin' over it again and again, an' I think I'm ready!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|That's why I came to you. I gotta make one of them dishes from Howlett's book, it's a Salted Fish Soup, an' it says it'll attract all sorta monsters! Especially birds. They love that fishy odor!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Alright, I'm gonna stop ramblin', startin' to sound like my Pa. So uh, you got any {{textcolor|green|Salted Fish}} to spare for me?}}

*''No worries, I'll get you some.''
*''It sounds kind of dangerous, you know.''

{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=No worries, I'll get you some.
|Aw yeah! You're the best! Gimme 'em when you're ready, I'm gonna go prepare everthin' else!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|answer=It sounds kind of dangerous, you know.
|Aw, c'mon, it ain't dangerous! The birds I'm lookin' for aren't like Rocket Roosters, they ain't dangerous at all! They'll jus' fly on over, an' play around a bit.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|indent=true|Jus' bring me some if you get it, alright? If you ain't got none, I can get it from someone else, too...}}
