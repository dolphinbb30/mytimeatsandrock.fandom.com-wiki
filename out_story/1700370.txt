{{dialogue|Luna|Oh, come on. I change my hair way more. Ah! I missed you so muuuuch!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|I missed you too. Right, is everything okay at home?}}

{{dialogue|Luna|And you, Ernie, is everything okay here...?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Haha, yes, I kind of felt the same way, but it's rare to hear that from you. Everything is good for me here, I've made a lot of friends and even gotten more inspiration...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|I've just been talking with your friend, ''Player'', here! So this is the five star Builder you told me about?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|That's right, my friend, ''Player'', is now famous throughout the whole Alliance!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|I'll say! And hm... Sandrock is also becoming more and more famous within the Alliance! I'll have to book more shows here in the future!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|So, you're headlining the summit? I'm looking forward to it. Let's see if you'll make the same mistake as last time and sing the wrong lyrics like you did at Atara-fest...}}

{{dialogue|Luna|Hmph, there's no way I'd make the same mistake twice! Just wait, I'll give the most perfect performance of my life in Sandrock!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|I'd better help my sister out. Enjoy the summit, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Luna|Too late, we're practically besties now! You missed your chance, Ernie...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Ah hah...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Hehe, as soon as you two were official, he wrote to our entire family to share the news! I... missed that particular letter, heh heh... had to hear the news from my agent!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Of course. It's responsible to inform loved ones, whether they're paying attention or not... but it's not all your fault. The mail system can hardly keep up with the shifting tides that are your feelings...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Whatever...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Here's my promise to you, ''Player''! If my brother ever bullies you, be sure to tell me, I'll go tell on him to our parents!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|You're still so childish. But I've already promised my dearest ''Player'' that I'll love and protect them forever, and never let them down.}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Oh... This is the first time I've seen my brother so sweet. ''Player'', looks like you're really special to him!}}

|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=5}}|Oh my, your lovey-dovey words are making my lyrics seem tame by comparison! Eh... just keep the PDA to a minimum, you two. At least in front of me!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|indent=true|answer=Luna! I just want to say, I've always been a fan of yours...
|Wow, you're actually my fan! I'm so honored!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|indent=true|Did you hear that, Ernest? The person you love is my fan! Which of us do you love more...!?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|Look at you, getting lost in compliments...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|indent=true|answer=I'm just glad we're getting a chance to meet like this!
|Me too! I'm so happy we ran into each other!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|While I'm here, you have to tell me more embarrassing stories about my brother. I'll be sticking around for a few days, so we'll have plenty of time to chat!}}
{{dialogue|Luna|For now though... I still have a few songs to go over! Let's catch up after the summit is over and we all have time!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|That was my plan from the beginning...}}
{{dialogue|Luna|Now it's my plan! Byeee!}}
