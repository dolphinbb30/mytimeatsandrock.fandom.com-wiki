{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, this is it folks. We're about to endeavor on the most important project we've ever done here in Sandrock. We're counting on you all! Heidi will speak more about the details.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Sure thing, Trudy. While you were checking out the generator, ''Player'', Commissioner Wei and I went over a feasibility plan to bring in the water from the north. Later I double checked with Director Qi as well.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Turns out a couple of things are working in our favor, for once. First, the reservoir is located at a higher elevation, meaning it'll take less energy to transfer the water to down here.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Second, since Mason and Yan already did us the work of connecting the auxiliary tank in the Sandrock Storage to the oasis, all we have to do is connect the northern reservoir to the auxiliary tank and the water will be in our water system.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So, our plan is to install pumps onto the northern reservoir, then install pipes and supports going into town. On top of this, Trudy has also requested that we add another pipe going to the Outback to connect with the Irrigation Tower. That's about it...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Director Qi has already provided me with diagrams for the Water Pump, Water Diversion Pipes, and Pipe Support. He... was in a hurry to get back to his research... Anyway, here they are.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Do you think it can be done? This is so important to us...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Thank you for the details, Heidi. And no worries, Mayor Trudy, it will be done.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|How about this, ''Player'' and Mi-an can each handle a section of the pipeline. ''Player'' can construct the North-South route into town, Mi-an can do the East-West route to the Outback. I'll do the internal piping leading to the Sandrock Storage.}}

*''Sounds good, Commissioner!''
*''I don't really wanna do a big project...''
*''I'll just construct it all.''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Sounds good, Commissioner!
|Yeah, we've got this!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|Then it's settled. Let's all give it our all! Install them on location when you're done!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=I don't really wanna do a big project...
|I understand the pressure you're under, ''Player''. I really do. But don't worry, the rest of us will do our part as well.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|And hey, just remember, this is our job. I do want to ease your burden, but I'd really appreciate it if you'd pull your weight too.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Come on, ''Player'', we've got this!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|Then it's settled. Let's all give it our all! Install them on location when you're done!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=I'll just construct it all.
|Haha, that's a good one, ''Player''! Nah, don't worry, we're not a team if we don't help each other. The rest of us will do our parts as well!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|Now come on, let's all pitch in together and all give it our all! Install them on location when you're done!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Yeah, we've got this!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Thank you all, I'm looking forward to the completion. In the meantime, I'll ask our town folk to donate anything they can to support your efforts.}}
