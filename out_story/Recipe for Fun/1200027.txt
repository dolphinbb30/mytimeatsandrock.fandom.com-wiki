{{dialogue|Matilda|''Player''! How are you?}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|I take it you got our letter? My, that Burgess... That child went around to everyone in town to check up on their wellness; he has such a big heart.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|The results he came back with, I must say, were rather shocking: eighty percent of those who took the survey reported that they were at least suffering some form of anxiety! Some from the Geeglers, some from the state of things.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|So I got together with our resident expert in fun, Catori here, and-}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Well, Catori, why don't you tell our fine Builder friend here what we came up with?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|It's my pleasure, Minister. I must thank you again for getting the Church to support this project.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|See now, ''Player'', way I see it, the only cure to these psychological drudgery type have-you-do, how-do-you-dos is one word: entertainment!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Seeing as Gecko Station has recently become unoccupied, we now have the opportunity to turn a negative into a positive: I present to you Sandsledding! But we won't call it that, no, too simple: we'll call it "{{textcolor|green|Sandrunning}}!"}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Sounds sleek and sophisticated, something the youth can identify with. Our tourism profits will quintuple overnight! And the mental health crisis, I assume... will also be resolved.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|This is where you come in, Builder. We need you to help us build up some of the things involved in creatin' such an attraction!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I've already explained our needs to Mi-an, she'll be making the Sandsleds. I need you to help us make the {{textcolor|green|Sign-in Table}}. Here is the diagram, I drew it up myself.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|When you're done, please install them {{textcolor|green|north of the 'ol Geegler building}}.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|How lovely! I love it when a plan comes together. Looking forward to seeing what the two of you come up with!}}
