{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Hmm...! Just think of all the battles we've had! Each one more glorious than the last, all stemming from that fateful day when I taught you the ropes... As I recall, you were on your way to... do... some boring thing that nobody could care less about...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|The student has indeed become the master...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=You never loved me.
|Ha! Know one thing about me, Skinny: any declarations I made on behalf of us was true. I make no mistakes, neither in war nor in love.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|You want proof? Well, it's not like I go around giving everyone nicknames! No... you were special in that regard. Perhaps it was always our destiny to be together...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|But I'm afraid that thread of fate has been cut short. I have chosen my country over love. Such is the duty of a Duvos Knight.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|I mean... I didn't even kill anyone you know personally! Or you! Which... I guess goes without saying. Being that we're having this conversation and all... Say! Why don't you come and visit me sometime? That is, if I don't bust out before then...!}}

{{dialogue|Stev|...}}
{{dialogue|Stev|Sir, I'm kind of reminded of something I saw back in Baja... See, after we'd taken the city, the whole place was a mess. A powerful wind blew over the town after we arrived, covering it in the dark clouds normally found above our home.}}
{{dialogue|Stev|One day, I happened upon some school children gathered around, laughing about something. I went over to check it out, and they were all admiring this little flower that had sprouted up out of the rubble...}}
{{dialogue|Stev|That made me kinda think that... no matter how dark it seems, no matter what's stopping us, or how bad things seem... as long as something is alive, it can try to keep growing.}}
{{dialogue|Stev|I guess what I'm saying is... everyone deserves a second chance, sir.}}
{{dialogue|Commander Lefu|...}}
{{dialogue|Commander Lefu|Fine. Maybe they'll see things favorably upon our return. I did fight bravely, after all. Give me that Sandrock milk. I'll need sustenance for the journey ahead.}}

{{dialogue|Commander Lefu|One lesson at a time, soldier.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I'm cool, though. Right, Pen?
|reward={{NPC2|Dan-bi|rp=-3}}|Uhhhh, sure, Skinny. Why not? Yeah, we're fellow warriors... separated only by lines on the battlefield... easily could've been on the same side, yadda yadda yadda.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Listen. At least I tried to make things better for myself. You all just... rolling around in the dirt, praying for plants to sprout out of nothing in some backwater nowhere town, I mean... what happens if you succeed, even!? A slightly more inhabitable wasteland?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I could've been rich in a big city, admired by all, living it up! I could've been a true hero. I risked everything, and I lost everything. Those were the rules. So forgive me if I seem less than devastated by the loss of a few "friends."}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|What happens if we succeed...?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Well... I-I'll tell you!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|We build our city up to be the best it could be! We become a shining example of what Telesis can really accomplish! And we make the world a better place, first for Sandrock, and then for all the Free Cities!}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Woohoo! Telesiiiis!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Yawn.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Hm...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Whatever happens, Pen...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I believe no one is beyond the reaches of the Light, even someone like you with their heart so deep in the shadows...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Ugh. You know I never believed in any of that junk, right?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Even if you never believed in the Light, the Light believes in you!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Ew. Okay. I'm starting to feel bad for me, too. Prison? Sure. But torture I did not sign up for.}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Yeah, you know what? Feeling's mutual, bub! Let's get outta here. Sandrock needs us!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Goodbye, Pen...}}
The conversation ends.
