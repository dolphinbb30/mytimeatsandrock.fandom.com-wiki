{{dialogue|Zeke|Hello, ''Player''. I was just talking to your friend here.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Ah, you're here, ''Player''! Mister Zeke was just showing me around the Moisture Farm. He said you repaired the Hydrogel!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Oh, by the way, Mister Zeke, Professor Luo said that if you want to grow bigger and juicier Tomatoes, you need to control the irrigation temperature. If the temperature gets too low, it's not conducive to proper absorption of nutrients.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Interesting... I didn't know that. Oh, and just call me Zeke.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|''Player'', I just remembered the little greenhouses you used to make me! I planted some Bananaberries there. They turned out delicious! So, so sweet!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Ah, I'm sorry. My mind likes to jump around a lot. I just say what pops into my head. ''Player'' used to call me "goldfish" because of it...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|I understand. It's nice to find someone with a similar love of botany.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|''Player'', what about you? Do you like planting here?}}

*''I'm the best farmer in town!''
*''I haven't tried it yet...''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=I haven't tried it yet...
|That's too bad... why don't you give it a shot? When you grow your own food, it really is an amazing feeling.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Alright, "expert." Since you're so high and mighty, let's do a little test.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|First question... which tool is necessary for planting in the desert?}}

*''A Hoe.''
*''A Grid Shovel.''
*''A Pickhammer.''
*''Erm... your hands?''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=A Hoe.
|Erm... that's not right. You use a Grid Shovel to lay the Straw in the field to form a Straw Grid. Then you can sow the seeds.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=A Grid Shovel.
|reward={{NPC2|Nia|rp=2}}|reward={{NPC2|Zeke|rp=2}}|Hmmm, that's right.}}

|Erm... that's not right. You use a Grid Shovel to lay the Straw in the field to form a Straw Grid. Then you can sow the seeds.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Next! What kind of produce can't be grown in the desert?}}

*''Sandrice.''
*''Coffee Tea.''
*''Lettuce.''
*''Sand?''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Sandrice.
|Wrong! Actually, these are pretty easy to grow here. They're really good for beginners. You can give 'em a shot.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Coffee Tea.

{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|answer=Lettuce.

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Lettuce and many other crops need sticky and moist soil. Although most of the Free Cities can grow them, it's a real struggle in Sandrock. But don't give up. I'm sure in the future, breakthroughs will be made, and we'll be enjoying Sandrock Lettuce!}}
