Title: Northern Eufaula Espionage Plans Foiled! Duvos Spies Captured!
Some time ago, the Northern Eufaula Development Plan jumped into full swing, but not without its share of complications. In an incredible twist of events, an investigation by the Alliance Council uncovered that some of the problems were in fact part of a deliberate campaign of disruption. 

Who is this dastardly foe? Well, let's ask one simple question. If the Northern Development Plan is to fail, who is to gain? None other than the Duvos Empire! 
How did this happen? In order to counter the Duvos activities, Alliance Central Intelligence carried out Operation Weeding. This operation quickly and efficiently identified and eliminated the Duvos infiltration, and effectively restored order to the Northern Development Plan once again. Currently, the plan as already initiated three settlements across the Northern Eufaula, next to the Duvos border.

Unfortunately, three Alliance operatives' lives were lost in the process. The youngest of them was a young woman in her twenties. She had achieved outstanding military achievements throughout her career and had made a lasting impact on the safety of the Free Cities. We shall never know the names of these brave heroes, but we, all of us, owe them our safety.

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Actually, I've always wanted this, in one way or another. I spent my working life protecting this kind of peaceful life, about time I get to enjoy it, right? (deep breath) Air's still warm and dry as ever. It's good to be back.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=So what are your plans for the future?
|No plans! At least not for a while. I've had enough "plans" for a lifetime in the service...}}
