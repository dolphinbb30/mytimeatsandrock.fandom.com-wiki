{{dialogue|Venti|In this version of the game, each of my hands will hold a bag with a prize inside. In one will be something of some value... an ore or a stone... in the other will be a better prize, like rubber scrap! Care to test your luck?}}
{{dialogue|Venti|So! Are you ready to choose a hand?I hope you get the rubber scrap!}}
