{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=It's fine, don't worry about it.
|If it weren't for you I think I'd probably be at Fang's right now!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Next time I do any climbing around, I should bring my equipment!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Well, I've got all the samples I need. Thanks for the help, ''Player''! See you later!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Nia... I want to tell you something. I like you...

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|You like me... for real?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|I... Oh, ''Player'', I'm so happy!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|I like you too! Of course I like you!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Since coming back to Sandrock I realized... quite how much you mean to me. That you weren't just my childhood friend...}}

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|reward={{NPC2|Nia|rp=20}}|But now... my childhood, my best friend, my life... it's finally real. My Builder...}}
