{{dialogue|Musa|First question. Do you know how many tourists come to Sandrock every year?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Uh... several... thousand? I see a few people coming off the train every day...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|According to my team in Atara, Sandrock sees a yearly average of less than 200 tourists.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah... so few...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Your current demographic consists of tourists and local residents. With your current volume of inventory, I would estimate that your net profits are probably around 1000 Gols per month. So how much additional profit would your gift box generate?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Uh... double?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Optimistic, but fine, let's say it doubles your income. Your monthly profits would be 2000 Gols. Let's take, for sake of argument, my previous investment into Highwind's general store. How much do you think that now makes?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ahh... I couldn't guess...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|It now has an operational income of 100,000 Gols per month. According to our contract, I receive 20,000 Gols per month return on my investment.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Wha... that's... so much...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Well, if that's all you have, then I think we're done here.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Wait! Mr Musa! I... uh... I have more!}}
{{dialogue|Musa|I'm listening.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Uh... my billboard! Right! You saw it when you came in! That'll double my income again! It's marketing-}}
{{dialogue|Musa|You don't understand. This "marketing" is just photos of you. What am I learning about the product? Where's the branding?}}
