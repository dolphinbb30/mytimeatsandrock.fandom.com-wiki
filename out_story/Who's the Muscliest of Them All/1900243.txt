{{dialogue|Qi|Greetings, ''Player''. Make any novel scientific discoveries today?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hm? Ah... the homunculus man has once again requested the design for an item far, far beneath the technological requisition standard of anything produced at this Research Center. How troublesome.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The last time he asked, I meticulously surveyed the exterior of my building to see if perhaps someone had mistakenly put up a sign reading, "furniture store." As I had originally hypothesized, no such sign existed.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The only logical conclusion I've been able to draw based on the available data is that Mr. Pen believes us to be his personal furniture acquisition assistants.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|...Yes, I believe I know a way, with your help, ''Player'', to indeed assure ourselves that we will be making no more mirrors. At least... not for our mutual associate, Mr. Pen.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Expect a diagram in your mailbox within a day or so. Thank you for this discussion, ''Player''. It has been most enlightening.}}

*''Sounds good.''
*''Nothing dangerous, right?''
*''Care to elaborate?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Nothing dangerous, right?
|Mm. I think, this time, I can honestly answer that with a "no."}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Care to elaborate?
|We'd best get back to work; homunculus man has already taken up so much of our time. Trust me, ''Player''. Trust the science.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Good luck.}}
