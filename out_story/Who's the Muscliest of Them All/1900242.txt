{{dialogue|Pen|Oho! Well, if it isn't my good-ish friend, Skinny Arms! Skulking outside my chamber door, on the off chance you might bask in my stout-hearted, rock-ribbed emanations, no doubt! Well, today is your lucky day!}}

*''I heard some noises...''
*''How's it going Pen...?''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I heard some noises...
|Some...? Ah... haha! That was simply an unfortunate altercation. I seem to have been let down somewhat...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=How's it going Pen...?
|Excellent, as always, Skinny. Excellent indeed... Well, almost excellent. I seem to have been somewhat let down...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Was there... someone else in there?
|Aha! Just me, myself, and I, Skinny! What's with the third degree?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|...Ah, Skinny! I can't hide it any longer. As the Sandrocker I respect the most and whose demeanor is also the most Pen-like in disposition, perhaps it would ease my heart to confess to you...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|You see, I was action rolling over to my mirror after finishing my new ten thousand squat routine to check my post-workout pump when I discovered to a mix of glee and horror...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|My muscles are now too burdgeoning to be contained by the surface area of my mirror!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|And in my moment of despair and anger... I killed...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|...It. My mirror. I broke my mirror, Skinny! I smashed it to a thousand pieces!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|You must... understand, these muscles, this perfectly crafted form, they do not come cheap or easy.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|No! They need constant care and attention. People have labelled my physique "quantum musculature," as only through observation does it take a defined shape.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|But I digress. The undeniable truth is... my gains have been exceptional lately. Look at my pecs. No, no. I mean, really look at them. Outstanding. I mean it's amazing they fit anywhere...}}

*''Sure, buddy.''
*''What are "pecs?"''
*{{flirt}}''They are magnificent.''
*''That's cool but I kinda gotta go...''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=What are "pecs?"
|Hm? Oh, come on, you know! Pecs! Pectoral muscles, the upper chest, chesticles, the crown jewels of the diligent bench presser! Try to keep up over here, Skinny...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=They are magnificent.
|Oho! It seems then you understand the urgency of the situation...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=That's cool but I kinda gotta go...
|Hm, you're right. I don't need you getting lost in them for hours...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|But wait... hear me out...! Since I've broken my mirror for being too small, you could go and build me...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|So, without a full and complete view of my body, I cannot truly know whether or not I've maintained my expected level of perfection. I need vision! I need a true view of my developments!}}

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=...I could build you a bigger mirror?

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|A larger mirror! Oh, but why stop there...?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Not just larger. Better, faster, stronger... The most advanced mirror known to man! Yes... Hm, but a pinnacle of scientific achievement such as this...}}
