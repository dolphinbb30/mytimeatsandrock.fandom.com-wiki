{{dialogue|Qi|Oh, ''Player'', are you here to bathe in the magnificence of the Olympia as well? The people from the Alliance have already left, they have given me the directive to research this facility. Another blank check... unbelievable...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Do you know what this place is?}}

*''It's a star ship shipyard!''
*{{flirt}}''It's your dream!''
*''It's where I kicked butts and took names!''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=It's a star ship shipyard!
|This is why you're my favorite Builder. Yes, it's a shipyard and launch facility for starships back during the Old World.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=It's your dream!
|I... won't deny it. It has been my dream since childhood to find the Olympia. This... is a shipyard and launch facility for the Olympia class starships during the Old World.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=It's where I kicked butts and took names!
|While that is very true... that wasn't the point I was trying to arrive at. This... is a shipyard and launch facility for the Olympia class starships back during the Old World.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Olympia is actually the name of an interstellar exploration program. I first read about it from the records onboard the Vega 5, which was to be the first stellar colony ship before it crashed during the Day of Calamity.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I'm not sure how salvageable everything is around here, I'm still cataloging, but don't get your hopes up. Our Duvos friends already went through everything.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Still, just by discovering this ruin is enough for me. It proves without a shadow of doubt now that the Olympia program existed... and has already sent ships out from our planet...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|There are still human survivors out there! Amongst the stars!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Knowing this will keep me up many a nights...}}
The conversation ends.
