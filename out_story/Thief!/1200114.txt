{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=Ask about when it disappeared
|Let's see, I use the magnifying glass to help me read before going to bed, so the first thing I do when I get up is to put it in my pocket. Uhm, no wait, I put on my reading glasses first, then get the magnifying glass from the nightstand.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|Then I'd get up to make breakfast. Hugo and Heidi would be up around that time, and you know what Hugo is like if he ain't got his breakfast. Big boy like that still hasn't learned to cook a grown man's meal. I swear one of these days...}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|Oh, I'm sorry child, I'm talkin' your ear off. Anyway, the thief must have snuck in at the crack of dawn, and done so quietly. I sleep light as a feather, and I didn't stir the slightest!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=Ask about where it was lost
|I carry it in my pocket during the day, I only set it aside on the nightstand when I go to bed. So the only place it could have possibly gotten stolen from is {{textcolor|green|from my room when I was asleep}}!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|Now that I think about it, I always open the window to get some air when I sleep. That must'a have given the thief a way in! I'll get Hugo to make me an iron window, that's what I'll do!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|indent=true|answer=Check the crime scene
|Crime scene? Child, make sure those Civil Corps boys pay you: you've got the lingo down and everything! Well I suppose the "crime scene," that'd be {{textcolor|green|my bedroom}}. You go right on ahead and check!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Is that all? My, you young folk sure do work quickly! You sure you don't want to hear about the rest of my day? Well, alright. I put all my trust in you to catch this darn thief! Good luck!}}

|It was before noon. I always take my ring off when I start work. Heavy hands lack a certain finesse... I usually put my ring on the front desk.}}

|Hm? Yes, just look around my shop for clues. What's it they say? The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime? Well if that happens, do be sure to catch them this time, darling!}}
