{{dialogue|Vivi|Justice, I got a situation to report. I rose this mornin', put the kettle on, put in my toast, and started doin' the laundry. 'Bout half way through the wash, I realised I'd left the toast burnin' in the toaster...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Eh, grams... I got a couple other cases to get through today, so if you don't mind, uh...}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Alright, alright! You used to love hearin' my stories... Point is: for the life of me, I just cannot find my magnifying glass! I got reason to believe someone went and crept in through the window and snatched it they did!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Just a magnifying glass? I mean, why would anybody... do that? Er... I'm sure it'll turn up around the house, just keep lookin'. You sure you ain't just misplaced it somewhere?}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Misplaced it!? Nerve of you whipper-snappers... I ain't lost a magnifying glass yet, and I don't plan on startin' now, uh-huh! I'm tellin' you, somebody glass-napped it!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Well... I mean, it's the first time I've heard of a stolen magnifyin' glass. Oh, it musta been a real nice one, right? Jewel encrusted, solid gold, handed down for generations, so on and so forth?}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Goodness, no! I've known you since you were playing yakboys an' bandits in little booties! Has my family ever come across as having that kind of money? It was made by my husband. It's got sentimental value, Maurice!}}
