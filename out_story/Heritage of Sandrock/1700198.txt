{{dialogue|Catori|These are all the materials? Wow, yeah, they sure are! Thanks a bunch, ''Player''! I'll get these over to Heidi on the double, and we'll start the expansion of the game center.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Next up, step two of Catori World - the Museum! The Mayor really came through and gave me a grant. "The Museum's a heritage of the town, afterall," that's what Trudy said. It means we can upgrade the Museum as well!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I don't know if you heard... but Heidi and Trudy are planning on opening a road directly to Portia. Who knows how many more tourists will be coming to Sandrock? A thousand? Ten? I can't let an opportunity like this slip!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Besides, haven't you been to the Shipwreck Ruins recently? I'm sure you found loads of new relics you're excited to show to the world!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Well... imagine it: countless tourists, all swarming to the Golden Goose and Museum, the "oohs," the "ahhs," the "dang how did I spend this many Gols..."}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Anyway. I figure we'll be needing some new Exhibition Stands for more relics and a new display to draw attention on an expanded rooftop. Planning ahead and all that. Can you help me out?}}

*''No problem!''
*''I'm kinda busy...''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=No problem!
|Haha, thank you! How did I get so lucky, huh? Got a partner with as much vision as me!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|Here's the Recipe for the Exhibition Stand, you can make it on the Worktable.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|Heidi will take care of the new rooftop itself, but I'll need your help for the display. Can you ask Director Qi to make you a Diagram? When you're all done, please install them on location.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I'm kinda busy...
|It's okay. I know I've pushed you, you must be pretty tired. You only just completed the Game Center after all. Tell you what, have a break, come back when you're free, I'll give you all the time in the world!}}
