{{dialogue|Heidi|Howdy, ''Player''! How'd you find the latest sandstorm? Gotten a grain of sand stuck up in your eyelid yet? Ooh, that's the worst... But hey, looks like our Sandrock's still standing; at least that's something.}}

*''They still scare me...''
*''Sandstorms? Nothing to fear!''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=They still scare me...
|Yep, well, you're not wrong. You'd be a fool not to observe at least a lil' bit of deference when it comes to one of the most powerful forces of nature there is!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Sandstorms? Nothing to fear!
|Izzat so! Most folks take a lot longer to get used to 'em. Glad you aren't scared, but don't forget to be careful out there, alright? Sandstorms are nothin' to mess around with.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey, since you're here, let me tell you what I've been working on lately! It's got to do with sandstorms, actually!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Introducing the "Single Action Near-perfect and Dependable Weather and Arid Lint Limiter," also known as... The SANDWALL! Once installed in your home, it'll be your last and only line of defense against the worst flying sands of the Free Cities!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Yeah, okay, it's basically just a regular wall to help keep the sand from a storm out of your yard with a press of a button. But, eh... whatever works, right?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Anyway, the prototype is almost finished; I've sent some of my diagrams over to Mi-an and... Say, you want in on this lil' connivance?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I'll even sweeten the pot for ya: bring me the stuff we're missing, and I'll get you a Sandwall at your workshop, on the house... ahem... well, for a good price, anyway!}}

*''No problem, I'll help you out!''
*''I've got a lot on my plate...''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=No problem, I'll help you out!
|Great! Well if it turns out you can help, come find me over at Construction Junction. Then we can start turning that workshop of yours into the home of your dreams. So long as your dreams involve Sandwalls!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=I've got a lot on my plate...
|Of course. No rest for the wicked. Not that you're wicked or anything... I mean... I don't know why I said that. I'm sure Mi-an can help me out, don't trouble yourself.}}
