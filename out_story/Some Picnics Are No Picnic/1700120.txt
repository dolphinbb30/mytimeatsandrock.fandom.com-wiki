{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey, ''Player''! Are you working? Goodness! I want whatever it is you're putting in your coffee. You're just like my sister, always putting in hours like an Ataran banker!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Speaking of my dear sister, I was planning on taking her out on a picnic soon, to help her relax a bit. As I said, she's really been burning the candle at both ends lately! Why don't you join us?}}

*''Sure, I could use a break.''
*''Too much on my plate right now...''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Sure, I could use a break.
|Great! It's like we say in Barnarock, "A bicycle can always use a third wheel!"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Now! Before we arrange a time, certain preparations must first be made!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|My sister is quite easily annoyed, trust me... Which means! We'll have to be careful to make this practically perfect in every way!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|For a proper picnic, of course, a basket of the picnic variety must be provided. Furthermore, said "Picnic Basket" must have picnic refreshments within!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|However, for now, I have... none of these. What to do, what ever shall I do?}}

:*''I'll make the Picnic Basket!''
:*''I'll get some food!''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|answer=I'll make the Picnic Basket!
|Wonderful! I'd imagine with those amazing crafting skills of yours, you'll be able to make us a basket the envy of picnickers 'cross the land!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|Meanwhile, I can head over to the Blue Moon and get us a good deal on the delectables. Owen owes me a couple of favors.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|reward={{i2|Picnic Basket|1}}|Here you are! One recipe for a Picnic Basket! See! I did think this through, somewhat!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|Once you're done, let's just go meet at the {{textcolor|green|Ceramic Gate and pick Amirah up}}. Oh, and let's try to get out in the next couple of days; I'm worried the sandstorms might be picking up again. See you soon!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|answer=I'll get some food!
|Ahah, well, it seems I'm caught, ''Player''. In fact, I must admit I had a bit of an ulterior motive with my previous statement. I was hoping that you with your amazing crafting skills could take care of the basket!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|No worries! I don't mean right this moment, of course! Ahah, if I may say so, you seem a bit on edge...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|All the more reason to come out on our picnic! Could I convince you to reconsider?}}

*''Well, alright!''
*''I really can't...''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I really can't...
|Of course, of course... I shouldn't have pressed you! Good luck with your pursuits, hope you can come along for some other adventure of ours.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Haha, wonderful! I knew you'd see the light! ...Not to be confused with the 'Light.' I like to keep Church and picnics separate, you know?}}
