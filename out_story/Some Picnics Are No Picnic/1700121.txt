{{dialogue|Arvio|Amirah, Amirah, my dear, dear sister! Come now, you said-}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|I know what I said, Arvio. This order has an exorbitant fee attached to it, and must be completed immediately. I'm surprised I have to explain there are things more important than... picnicking.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|You've been working past sundown like this for days now, when does it end? Look who's here? ''Player''! We prepared everything for this picnic together. Come out and take a break, you'll thank yourself, and me, later!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Good. You prepared it together, you can go together. You won't be needing me. Now if you please, I must return to my work.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Won't be n-?! We did this for you, not for ourselves! I invited ''Player'' because I knew they'd make this event that much more special...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I know you're older than me, but I'm your brother! It can't always be you taking care of me, you know?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|I'm aware, Arvio. It is not my intention to question that. I'm sure you'll get a chance to "take care of me" soon. Just not today. So, if you please-}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Tell us about the order, what more do you have to do?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|It's for Pablo's friend in Atara, he's working on a display for a flower festival and wants his booth to stand-out. The main pieces are finished, now I just have about ten or so more standard urns for the more common plants...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ten standard urns!? They want to custom make and ship standard urns all the way to Atara?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|My craftsmanship is esteemed...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|My sister: know that my love for you is great and my respect for your talents is never-ending... but an urn is an urn!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|This is a matter of quantity over quality! ''Player'', are you thinking what I'm thinking?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|You really mustn't bother yourselves with this...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I'm afraid we really must! It's as they say back home, "Three heads are more than none!"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|''Player'', if you and I help out, we can finish this task in no time, and our lovely rose here won't be forced to wither away, and instead, join us in the coruscating sunshine! What do you say?}}

*''We can do it!''
*''I'm not much for pottery...''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=We can do it!
|Alright! Our hands are your hands, Am! So come on, let us help!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I'm not much for pottery...
|No worries, ''Player''! It's just like playing with mud!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Ahah, I should say... a bit more complicated than that, but really! I think we can handle Ami's most basic product!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Let us help, Am! Our hands are your hands!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|It seems there's no stopping you two... Alright. I believe it is as you say, with more hands, I can get ahead on this order, and as such... I might be willing to take the day off tomorrow.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Woohoo!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|However! You must follow my instructions carefully!  Simple or not, everything that comes from my shop has my name on it; despite your good intentions, I won't have my reputation dragged through the mud, understood?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Dear sister, the only thing getting dragged through the mud today is...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Clay!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|So now that you're out, you're having fun, aren't you? You know it's not easy convincing you, don't you?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Hm. Indeed.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|You see, ''Player'', this is what you get when you win an argument with my sister: hours of backbreaking labor, followed by terse acknowledgement at best.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|...Which is all completely worthwhile!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|In any case, I think this all proves that I ought to be listened to once in a while!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|To constructive advice, brother, of course, I'm all ears. But do remember that we didn't leave the harshness of Barnarock just to lie around here with books on our faces...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah, I pray that you speak no more of that place; my heart can hardly handle its very mention... ''Player'', have you ever been to Barnarock?}}

*''Never.''
*''I've always wanted to go.''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Never.
|There is an old Barnarock saying, "When it rains, it pours. But not in Barnarock. Because it never rains nor pours." But, uh, while it's okay for us to say it, I wouldn't go spouting that one off as a foreigner...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Our home is on a plateau. It gets hot during the summer and very cold during the winter, with little else to make up for it.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|No resources, no farmland, no opportunities! I guess the cantaloupes aren't half bad.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I've always wanted to go.
|Ah, well... to travel, sure. But I wouldn't dream of trying to ever work there as a Builder! There's not much that needs building, and hardly any ruins of value to dive in...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Our home is on a plateau. In a visit, one could enjoy the scenery. But when the holidays are over, the tourists go home, and locals like us are left to bake in a kiln.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I had to work in a quarry all day. And I didn't have a cool boss like Rocky! One can only bear so much humiliation for daily bread. Finally I just quit, and shortly after, Amirah and I made the journey here to Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|This place has its faults, but one mustn't forget to see the trees for the forest! I might not be so impartial, but I've never enjoyed such freedom as being my own boss here in Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|And it's all because you brought me here and helped me get started, Am! I won't forget your kindness!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|We're family. Besides, you have also been a great help to me.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|The true kindness is that of our parents; they gave up everything to send us here.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Don't you worry! Pretty soon my shop is gonna be raking it in. I'll take care of Ma and Pa! You just enjoy life!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Confidence is one thing, brother, but perhaps you should wait to boast 'til after you've a little more to show for yourself...}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|Oh, brother...}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|answer=Business requires more maturity...
|reward={{NPC2|Amirah|rp=5}}|Indeed. Customers expect a constant air of professionalism... that you currently lack.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|But you've heard what our parents say, I have "potential!" And there's that phrase, how does it go... if you have a bird and there're two birds in the bush, you're pretty much guaranteed to have three birds!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I'll cheer you on, Arvio!
|Wow, I've never had anyone rooting for me before! Hold on... what's this pressure I'm feeling? I'll work twice as hard to live up to your expectations, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|Indeed. Follow through on such words. Do not take other's support for granted.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Don't get cocky Arvio, need I remind you of the cash crunch incident involving your supplier not long ago?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Oh, come on, Am, that's so last year. Let's live in the present! Have you tasted the food? That Owen, what a genius! You need to get the recipe!}}
