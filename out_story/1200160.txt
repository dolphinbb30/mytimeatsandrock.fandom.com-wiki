{{dialogue|Ernest|I'm going to be interviewing some of you in the coming days, and also taking pictures of the trees you have growing out in the desert. It'll be an ongoing piece, I'll be putting out articles as this greenery project continues to make progress...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ahem, yes! We welcome you back with open arms, Mr. Ernest! That is, once the forest has grown out a bit more... Which... it certainly will!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Wonderful! As they say in Barnarock, "counting your chickens before they hatch is a good way to predict how many chickens you'll soon have!"}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Right... Anyhoo, everyone is invited to be in a group photo, so I hope you can all try to stay flexible within the next few days. City Hall will send out a letter with the time and date as soon as possible.}}
