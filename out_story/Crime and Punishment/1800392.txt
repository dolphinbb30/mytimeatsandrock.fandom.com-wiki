{{dialogue|Trudy|Hello, ''Player''. Burgess. How can I help you?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Mayor, we're here to request you stop the transfer of Miguel to Atara! He's changed!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Changed?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I- I wanted to say he was tricked by Duvos, manipulated by Matilda... and he was! But no, he's just very sad nowadays... he wanted something that's not his to decide... and now that he's acknowledged the destruction he's left behind, he's... broken!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Go on...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|He's not innocent, but he's also not a bad man! He was a victim of circumstances. He-}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Did he ask you to come here?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|No, he told us he wants to face his crimes... I just think it's not right!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Burgess... you...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Mayor Trudy, I implore you. Let Miguel face his punishment, but here in Sandrock! Where he can face everyone he's wronged and atone for what he's done. Don't let him rot in a cell forever, every fiber of my being is telling me that's not right.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|''Player'', what do you think of all of this?}}

*''I've seen it myself, he really has changed.''
*''If Burgess says it's the case...''
*''No, I think he's putting it on.''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=I've seen it myself, he really has changed.
|So even ''Player'' agrees...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Sigh... I trust you. Although my gut is telling me this is a bad idea...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|I will cancel the transfer to Atara. We can supervise him for a little longer in Sandrock prison, and then I will entrust him to you, Burgess.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|You can count on me, Mayor Trudy! He'll be good, I'll vouch for him!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Look, we can't take this lightly. If I see any sign of him falling back into his old ways...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|Then I'll take the responsibility.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|OK. For now he'll work under you. The Civil Corps will come up with a plan for his punishment.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|You can count on us, Trudy!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Prove to me that this isn't a bad idea. If there's anyone that can pull it off, it's you two.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|We'll make the preparations, and I'll make an announcement soon. Let's first try and get the groundwork setup quietly so as not to make too many waves around town...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|You got it, Mayor!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=No, I think he's putting it on.
|You're sure?}}

:*''I'm joking, he really has changed.''
:*''Completely.''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=double|answer=I'm joking, he really has changed.

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=double|answer=Completely.
|I'm inclined to agree.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=double|But- but...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=double|I was willing to listen if both of you felt that way, but I trust ''Player'''s judgement as well. I understand where you stand, Burgess, and were this anyone else I would be on your side.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=double|But in consideration of what he has done, and his proven ability to manipulate, I will err on the side of caution. He goes to Atara.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=double|I... understand, Mayor Trudy.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=double|Look, Burgess, I'm not heartless, but I just need to do what's best for all of us. Thank you for coming in. Really. We're lucky to have a Minister with a heart as big as yours.}}
