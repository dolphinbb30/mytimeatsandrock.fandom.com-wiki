{{dialogue|Miguel|I was preaching what I believed. But even then, in my pursuit of my ideal I ended up precipitating the very thing I was trying to prevent. I wronged you, Burgess... I led you astray. Took advantage of you.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|That's in the past now, Miguel. Besides, I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren't for you. For better or for worse, I can't regret the past. We can only look forward into the future.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Ah, well, let me impart one last bit of wisdom to you: sometimes, even when you're so very, very sure, you still need to reflect and ask the tough questions... I have given this much thought while I have been in here... and...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|Burgess is correct. I understand what I did, and know my guilt. I simply do not seek forgiveness. I don't deserve it.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|You have both been a sliver of light in my incarceration. I am glad I have you both with me in my final moments before leaving to meet my fate.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|This isn't right...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|This is as it shall be. Acceptance of one's wrongs does not free one from guilt. And Burgess, don't be a hypocrite, you yourself always stood for upholding the rules, don't make the exception for me.}}
