{{dialogue|Cooper|You said they did what now? Duvos said they didn't "KNOW" there was gonna be a whole army runnin' up on Sandrock!?}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Surely a lie... But if we choose to "believe" it, war can be avoided.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|What in the sam- I say what in the sand farmin' Monday to Friday calamari cat crap is that!?}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|They've backed down. They had a bunch of other agents and spies turn themselves in. We got some of our people back from Lucien. Duvos looks weak. I think we can count on them being a lot less bold, at least for a while.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|That sounds like a load of bull puckey to me! "Tell us how many other secrets you're keeping from us!" Yeah, sure, pal...! If'n y'all think they're really gonna tell us everything, I got a Yakmel Kart to sell ya!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Surely they know that we know. Didn't we intercept the calls between Matilda and Duvos? Both sides are lying to each other...}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|That does seem to be the case...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Well. Maybe it really was Matilda all along! And... the telegraphs were faked!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Why don't you fly up there and ask her yourself?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Maybe I will!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ahem... Sounds like a return to an uneasy peace... ''Player'', have you seen the news? The paper published an official report on everything that happened here, it just made its way into town today...}}

Title: Aftermath of Duvos Invasion: War off the Table... For Now
Tensions are simmering as negotiations between the Alliance and Duvos have reached a tentative, but peaceful standstill.

It is now widely known: Duvos's recent invasion of Sandrock was a direct violation of the cease fire. But Duvosian Emperor is disavowing knowledge of the military action, claiming that an agent known only as "Matilda" was acting alone in organizing and carrying it out. 

Dubious, the Alliance agreed that they would back down on the condition that any other Duvos agents operating covertly within Alliance territory reveal themselves. So far, over twenty Duvos agents have come forward to be extracted. Furthermore, an exchange has taken place involving the return of Lucien prisoners to the Alliance.  Negotiations are still ongoing.

It cannot be understated the incredible bravery that the people of Sandrock put on display as they uncovered this plot, and furthermore held off the invasion long enough for reinforcements to arrive. It is because of their courage that Sandrock yet stands, and the powerful relics below the newly discovered ruins remain under Alliance control.

War criminals, Commander Lefu and the knight, Pen, have been transferred to maximum security prisons where they will serve life sentences on multiple charges included, but not limited to, illegal occupation of Alliance territory, grand conspiracy, and first degree murder. Duvos has disavowed their crimes and not requested prisoner exchange. Other POWs, who the Duvos Empire has identified as rogue agents, will be sent back to Duvos for tribunal.

The Atara Times will continue to follow and report on this incident as it unfolds.

{{dialogue|Trudy|I think each side is aware of the other's intentions. All this posturing is to reassure the public... it's hard to say what's really going on behind the scenes.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Whatever the case, I'd tell anyone you know to steer clear of the border for the foreseeable future.}}

*''Duvos is lying about everything!''
*''I hope they go easy on Stev...''
*''Wow. Life in prison for Pen?''
*''They're just licking their wounds...''
*''Think I'd better go.''

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=Duvos is lying about everything!
|Hit the nail on the head! Can't trust 'em as far as you can throw 'em! And I'd like to see anybody throw an entire nation. Maybe I could but that's beside the point. Clearly all this is a step towards complete and utter world domination!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|Think you're getting pretty ahead of yourself with that one, pal...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Our relations with Duvos grow more tense by the day. But we don't want to fight a war; even one we can win. Whatever their motives, I think what's best is to make sure they never think for a second attacking us will end well for them.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Ah hah! A cold war kept in place by mutually assured destruction! What better way of keeping peace in the world...?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|That's one way of putting it... Ultimately, I believe the Alliance's goals are to appear strong enough that Duvos wouldn't dare attack. They don't have the resources we do, and I think the stunt they pulled proves they don't have the relics, either.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|At some point they'll have to stop all this... Operating the way they do just isn't sustainable. What is their Emperor thinking? All we want is to trade with them, treat them as equals like we do with Seesai, Ethea, and the rest...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Of course... I'm just speaking my mind. I don't know what the Council is planning... I look forward to a chance to speak with them on the matter and voice our opinions.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|For now, though... I think all we can do is focus on Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|I'm with you, Trudy. Let's leave the politics to the professionals, eh, Coop?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Eh... yeah. If news can't be summarized as "good" or "bad" in ten seconds or less, I'm out.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=I hope they go easy on Stev...
|Hm... that soldier who surrendered, yes? Well, Duvos has requested that the Alliance send back their troops for "tribunal..." We're pretending that they're rogue agents, remember? "Traitors" to the Duvos cause...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Heck, I wouldn't be too surprised if some of them "get lost on the way home." Perfect time to disappear and join the Free Cities. Nobody really wants war...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Aw... What a sorrowful tale... Woe is the man forced to suffer the consequences of his own actions...! Where's that feller holed up again? I'd like to send over a gift... The world's smallest fiddle!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|So he can... play himself the saddest song in the world?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Y... Yeah!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=Wow. Life in prison for Pen?
|Yes'r! As it should be! If'n you ask me, shoulda been he we done shot into space! Who made that call, anyhow?}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|It's a shame. A guy with talents like that... He easily could've been the hero he always pretended he was. Wonder what happened that got him so messed up...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Well, there's no changing what happened... what he did. I just hope... one day he takes some responsibility for his crimes.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=They're just licking their wounds...
|Yep... pretty much. They're downplaying the whole operation, no doubt just thinking about their next move. Meanwhile we're still searching for more Duvos operatives; the ones they'll certainly "forget" to tell us about...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Although, what if we do find more spies? After they say they recalled them all? How bad would that be?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|I don't know...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Sigh... Spies in Meidi... Of all places...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Well, if ever there was a time to speed up our North Development plans... Duvos has given us every reason we need. Them being aggressive towards us and Ethea will only encourage us to bolster our defenses.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Eh... I dunno... they slipped through once, they could slip through again. Maybe we need to start preparing at home! ''Player''! What's your schedule like for the next year? Nevermind that, put us down for eight thousand air cannons. Yer country needs you!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|The north plan isn't an invitation for war... even if it was, the fighting wouldn't be in Sandrock for years. The purpose of the plan is just to improve transportation around the Free Cities, get rid of blind spots.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Ah... hah. Pa, when did you decide to get so involved in world politics?}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|I dunno, how about after our home was invaded and nearly brought to ruin? Besides... just our responsibility as citizens of Sandrock and part of the Alliance to stay up to date with such affairs...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Think I'd better go.
|They wouldn't be stupid enough to try something like that again anytime soon. The way I see it, our path to a better Sandrock is wide open.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|Couldn't have said it better myself!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Look at you Pa and your nuanced takes on hot-button issues...!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|Just a proud Sandrock citizen, that's all. Always have been.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|That ain't how I recall it. 'Member how you used to always get up in a fuss everytime ol' Lou tried to tell you what to do? Heh heh, "It's for the good of the town, Hugo!" "I'll show you good of the town," then you'd get a big ol' plume o' smoke out the forge! Haha, 'member?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Huh... 'member...? Why's yer face goin' all red? All the blood rushin' to yer head... for the 'memberin'...?}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|indent=true|Look! That was then, this is now! People change. Things... change.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|Ah... hah...! Suuure... I read ya loud and clear, pal! You're tryin' to putchyer big ol' braaaain on display here in front of-}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Weeeell, you know what they all say: something something, don't talk too much about politics and religion... I think we all have a lot to get back to don't we? Bet ol' Bessie's hungry, eh, Uncle Coop...?}}
