{{dialogue|Arvio|Congratulate... me?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Yes. Obviously, you took all my words to heart. Not long ago, your general store appeared on the first page of my assistant's "Emerging Businesses Hot or Not" list. You... as it were... were "hot."}}
{{dialogue|Musa|This indicates that, by various measures, your store is performing well. And your market share is steadily rising.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|That's right, Mr. Musa. After that, I did everything you suggested, and started to try to have more foresight! And I guess you could say... it worked like a charm! So... thanks!}}
{{dialogue|Musa|No, young man, you should thank yourself.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|I see the changes in you. And no man is an island. I don't doubt there are more people in your life other than myself who pushed you to be better either.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Yes! ''Player'' has also helped me a lot!}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Hm, indeed. The impact that Builders can make on this world is huge. I believe with young people like you in Sandrock, development can only get better and better.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Thank you, Mr. Musa. So... will you invest in me this time?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Of course. I'll have my assistant get in touch with you.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|That's great! ''Player'', did you hear that? I finally getting investment from Mr. Musa!}}
