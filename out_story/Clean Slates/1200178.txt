{{dialogue|Mort|Oh, hello, ''Player''. Are you here to sweep the graves, too?}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Mm, one shouldn't assume... I thought you were young Fang's friend, here to help him with the cleaning. That boy comes here every weekend; hardly ever says a word, that one.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Makes you wonder, but can't say I mind the company, quiet as it may be.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Well, if you're here, perhaps you could help young Fang? It's easier with help, and I'd hate to burden the boy further. He insists on coming every week, perhaps out of sympathy for these aging bones of mine...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Yes, yes, just give him a hand sweeping up. He might not say anything, but I know deep down he'll be thankful. That is, if you're willing?}}

*''Okay, I'll help.''
*''I have a lot on my plate right now...''

{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|answer=Okay, I'll help.
|Well, thank you young one. When you're done, I'll treat you to a warm cup of tea.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|indent=true|answer=I have a lot on my plate right now...
|I understand. Well, fortunately grave sweeping isn't particularly tough. Fang keeps it pretty clean and tidy himself...}}
