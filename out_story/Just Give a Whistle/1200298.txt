If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|I hadn't really planned to visit Portia, but now that you've almost finished the tunnel, I'd be a fool not to.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Y'all put whistles in the tunnels to get rid of the monsters? Do the whistles go "woo woooooooo?"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Word to the wise, ''Player''! As soon as Portians start showing up in Sandrock, believe you me, the price of local items like Yakmel Sausage is going to shoot through the roof! At least... I hope it will. I ordered a hundred boxes of it...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Whew. With Miguel out of the picture, I've had to do the books for the Portian water imports myself, and believe you me, it's not easy! More water, more problems...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Railways to Atara and Highwind, road to Portia... think it's safe to say we can expect an over fifty percent increase in tourism... Right? Because people from Vega 5 and Tallsky will travel trough Portia...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Heard y'all made short work of them gigantic Sandworms! Good on ya! Got no use for gigantic Sandworms 'round these parts! Unless... well, I reckon you could put 'em in cages, open a theme park! Charge two Gols a gander. Not a matter of if 'er not we should, we could!}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I'm excited to try fresher Portian water! Will it taste any different? ...Will it taste different because I know it's not rerouted through Atara...? Ah! Ri-ri and I will just do a blind taste test. As they say, for science!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Those whistles'll get the job done, don't you worry yer pretty lil head about it!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Books are like a tunnel to another world! Your tunnel... is... a tunnel to another world. Congratulations on being the real thing!}}
{{dialogue|Fang|A tunnel to Portia... I wonder if it's warm there... this time of year...?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Great work in the tunnel as usual, ''Player''! It's also nice to see Elsie stepping up. I've enjoyed taking a break from the action after the whole Duvos debacle...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Digging this tunnel was a steep enough challenge just having the mountain to deal with... I hate that you always seem to get dragged into the worst of it, ''Player''. Just know that we all think of you as a hero to this town!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Shame we had to resort to using noise pollution to scare those monsters out of the tunnel. If only we could've let 'em know that it was you comin' for 'em, ''Player'', that would've gotten 'em out in a jiff.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|In Portia I heard there's an animal called the Panbat. I'm gonna ride that bus over there and bring me back a whoooole mess of 'em...}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|They don't have a train in Portia; so I'm hoping to make some new friends when they surely come over here to ask about ours!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Sounds like your monster hunter crew took care of the tunnel problem without a hitch. That's great news! I, er, guess I would like to point out that the Civil Corps still only has three core members and... creating a new faction for monster hunting- er... you know what, never mind! We can have this discussion another time...}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|I heard they opened up a shop in Portia where an old woman sells chainsaws. Think I'm gonna... wait a few months before checkin' that place for myself. Make sure there's no crazies, y'know?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Was pretty swell huntin' down critters with you, ''Player''. Elsie pulled her weight, too. I'm not sure I'll ever think the same way about monster huntin' solo...}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Logan says that Elsie was a real help when you all were in the tunnels. I must admit, I am proud to hear that...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|It's so great to see Elsie really finding her place; it's been good for our friendship, too! Now that she has her own monster hunting stuff to do, she never asks me to skip work to duck into the game center anymore...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Hm... when you saw the light at the end of the tunnel... the one to Portia... tell me... what was it like...?}}
{{dialogue|Mort|I never thought I'd visit Portia. But because of the efforts of you and your friends... I think I will.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Hey, heard the new tunnel is almost roadworthy thanks to you! I'll make sure to get the Yakmel Milk ready for when the Portians get here. Bet they'll buy you a round soon as they hear how you handled those Sandworms!}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|Can't wait to see all the new faces from Portia. Wait a sec, do I have any exes from Portia...? Hm... Hm hm hm... I don't... thiiiiink so...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Given time, I'm sure I could've come up with something to vaporize all those tunnel monsters for you but... I suppose there is some merit to the humane method devised by the rancher's daughter. In any case, I'm quite looking forward with more frequent visitations with my good friend Sleepyh- Mint.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Portia has some pretty sweet wood; grows back super fast, too. I never wanna live there... imagine dealing with that kind of pressure...}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Wonder if the Salvage Co. can't pick up a couple of new recruits from Portia... Although I heard their ruins are just like... one big chunk of gravel or somethin'. I dunno if they have what it takes to salvage over here...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I can't wait to take Jasmine on a ride to Portia! She's never been out of the city. Before she was too young and lately, well. You know! It's always wonderful to broaden one's horizons...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Sandworms? In my tunnel? It's more likely than you think.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|I feel bad for the monsters in the tunnel. They thought they found a lovely new place to live, with a nice roof over their heads. Then... we destroyed them and installed annoying whistles to keep them away...}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|The nerve of those Sandworms, thinking they can take up residence in our tunnel? Get your own! Sheesh...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Congratulations to all of us for the completion of a successful project, the Portia tunnel! I hope it will the first of many, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|All my plant buddies are up in Highwind or Meidi, but who knows? Maybe I'll make some new friends from Portia when they visit.}}
