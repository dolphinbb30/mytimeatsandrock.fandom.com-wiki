Title: Biocrust Breakthrough! (Please Read: Not Boring)
Hey! Do not look away from this page! Yes, this is a science article, but trust me, if you live in Sandrock, you're going to want to hear about this!

Sure, perhaps a more pertinent headline might have something to do with the fact that Mayor Trudy may have slightly circumvented certain legal traditions by leading a top secret diving party into an unexplored ruins, but... well, hey, can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs!

For more on this, we interviewed resident omelet enthusiast, Grace of the Blue Moon: "I totally get the point you're trying to make, but I read recently that there were actually Old World devices that would clone chicken egg material, eliminating the need for eggs or... cracking. Bit of a head trip, but cruelty-free, so... yeah good luck picking a side there." Thanks for the insight, Grace! Exactly the pivot I needed for this article!

With that out of the way, let's talk facts. Fact of the matter is, Zeke's biocrust studies have hit a major breakthrough with this latest batch of samples brought in! In a rather miraculous turn of events, said diving party of ambiguous statutory standing uncovered an Old World bio-facility that specialized in experimenting on plants and maybe... on a creepier note, also animals.

Within, our brave and totally forgivable crew found technology related to plant nutrition, and it is the opinion of experts within our community that indeed this technology will be what we need to supercharge desert planting around the oasis and be a big step towards a greener Sandrock!
