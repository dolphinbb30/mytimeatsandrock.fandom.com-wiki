The player can begin the mission by speaking to the following character:

{{dialogue|Nia|I could take a break from work, want to go camel riding?}}

*''Yeah let's go!''
*''I'm kind of busy right now...''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Yeah let's go!
|Yes! You're the best! I can't wait!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Hehe, y'know, this kinda reminds me of when we were young...}}

:*''When we'd ride the gliders together!''
:*''When you fell off that horse...''
:*''I don't really remember...''
:*{{flirt}}''I'm just happy you're here with me now...''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=double|answer=When we'd ride the gliders together!
|Yeah! We'd sneak out after lunch and just soar... it's a different feeling but it just feels kind of nostalgic!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=double|answer=When you fell off that horse...
|Hey! That was the first time I rode one thank-you-very-much! It's not like we had much opportunity to practice in Highwind.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=double|answer=I don't really remember...
|Typical! I swear, your memory is so bad! It's like you only remember the most and the least important, and nothing in between.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=double|answer=I'm just happy you're here with me now...
|I... Me too. I missed you so much... now I'm finally here, I think I'll stick around for a while this time...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=I'm kind of busy right now...
|Aw, really? You can't make some time for me? Darn... Hmm, I think I have some work to get done as well. Rain check on the ride, I guess.}}
