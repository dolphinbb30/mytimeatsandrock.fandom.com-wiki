Title: I Believe in Sandrock!
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times... wait, got that mixed up; it was the worst of times, and then... the best of times!

That seems as good a way as any to describe the events that unfolded recently at the Blue Moon as Musa made his way into what turned out to be a very unwelcoming welcome party. Now, this reporter doesn't really feel the need to dwell on facts such as "who exploded what" or "what ignited whom," but rather, let us focus on the result!

After a rather dismal first act, it looked like we'd ruined our chances to impress Musa, that is until... the tables turned! And were set on fire! And promptly extinguished. It was an extinguishing... of hope!

Mort shared with us all the most moving of tales... one of loss, one of regret, but ultimately, a tale of inspiration. He spoke solemnly, gaze aligned squarely at our wealthy guest, tears forming in his eyes... 

"I believe in these people. I believe in Sandrock." 

Powerful words. So much so that even the calculating businessman, infamous for his heart of stone in the negotiation room, had no choice but to reconsider his refusal to invest in our town. 

Regardless of Musa's ultimate decision, this reporter is thoughtlessly jumping on the bandwagon. I believe in Sandrock, too!
