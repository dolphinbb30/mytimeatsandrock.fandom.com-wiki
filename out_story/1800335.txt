(cId 1) A conversation 4098_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|The Zero model is far more tuned, and allows for maneuverability and a twofold increase in power.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Granted, the extra maneuverability allows for a more controlled experience. But the Leaf model is excellent for aim, the pinpoint accuracy of the Gauss rifle is just astonishing. It also has a far greater amount of field testing.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|That's an interesting point. I suppose the lack of variation on the Zero means that efficiency is reduced, but the dexterity more than makes up for it. The greater field testing of the Leaf is simply due to the lower cost and mass availability.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|That's what makes the Leaf model so interesting. The mass production led to overwhelming power, particularly in the Gryps Incident. In that conflict, it was the abundance of the Leaf model that allowed for the swift victory.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I'm sure ''Player'' is familiar, which model do you prefer?}}

*''Are you talking about the Mobile Suit?''
*''I prefer the Zero model.''
*''I prefer the Leaf model.''
*''This just sounds like nonsense to me...''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Are you talking about the Mobile Suit?
|Well...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|We are talking about Mobile Suits...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Not necessarily Sandrock's...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|answer=I prefer the Zero model.
|I agree. Perhaps it is the design. There are subtle curves, and the expert engineering is sublime.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I will concede that the engineering design of the Zero model is particuarly beautiful, I perhaps am focusing on utility rather than overall appeal.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I prefer the Leaf model.
|Another eye for the masterwork of engineering. Being applicable for mass production, as well as the ease of use for common soldiers, it surpasses the aesthetic value and the power of the Zero model.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|Perhaps you are correct. If we are looking purely at the efficiency and utility, the Leaf model is incredible.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=This just sounds like nonsense to me...
|Ah... I think you may not have understood our conversation...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|Yes, you need to be familiar with the lore...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|I'm completely lost... are you talking about the potential new upgrades to the Mobile Suit for planting?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh? Uhh... no, we just have a shared interest in a certain Old World franchise...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Indeed. Ahem... perhaps we should return to our task, we seem to have been somewhat distracted.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Right.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Ooookay...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|So, you said that you have already made several changes to the basic design of the Mobile Suit, most recently for digging the tunnel, correct?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes. I have managed to convince the City to use it in an official capacity, thus far we have used it twice. Through my research, the functionality has been increased considerably.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Interesting. I think perhaps it can be further repurposed for Project Greenland. I believe that the Little Woods project, while effective, was done by hand, is that right?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|That's right.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Wow, that must have been really hard work...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|For this new effort, creating the straw grid by hand will be far too time consuming. The Mobile Suit is needed if we're to create the foundations for the woods more efficiently...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I'm listening...}}
The conversation ends.
