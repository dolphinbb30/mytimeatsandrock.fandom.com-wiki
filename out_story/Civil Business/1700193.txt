Title: Biocrust Breakthrough! (Please Read: Not Boring)
Hey! Do not look away from this page! Yes, this is a science article, but trust me, if you live in Sandrock, you're going to want to hear about this!

Sure, perhaps a more pertinent headline might have something to do with the fact that Mayor Trudy may have slightly circumvented certain legal traditions by leading a top secret diving party into an unexplored ruins, but... well, hey, can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs!

For more on this, we interviewed resident omelet enthusiast, Grace of the Blue Moon: "I totally get the point you're trying to make, but I read recently that there were actually Old World devices that would clone chicken egg material, eliminating the need for eggs or... cracking. Bit of a head trip, but cruelty-free, so... yeah good luck picking a side there." Thanks for the insight, Grace! Exactly the pivot I needed for this article!

With that out of the way, let's talk facts. Fact of the matter is, Zeke's biocrust studies have hit a major breakthrough with this latest batch of samples brought in! In a rather miraculous turn of events, said diving party of ambiguous statutory standing uncovered an Old World bio-facility that specialized in experimenting on plants and maybe... on a creepier note, also animals.

Within, our brave and totally forgivable crew found technology related to plant nutrition, and it is the opinion of experts within our community that indeed this technology will be what we need to supercharge desert planting around the oasis and be a big step towards a greener Sandrock!

{{dialogue|Justice|Howdy there, ''Player''! Heard you had a pretty crazy time in the Shipwreck Ruins? Wasn't too tough for ya, was it?}}

*''No sweat.''
*''It was pretty tough!''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=No sweat.
|Dang, you're tougher than the sand and rocks 'round here, huh? Wish I coulda seen what that Caretaker bot was like before you took it down.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=It was pretty tough!
|But you made it through alright, ain't got a scratch on you!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Well, we did an initial check, there are still some Old World AIs roaming around, but the poison gas you ran into seems to have dissipated.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|So, we're thinkin' of openin' it up as a Hazardous Ruin. Let people dive around, see what it's got in store.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|For that to happen, we'll need a {{textcolor|green|Ladder}} to get in. I can tell you right now, we ain't throwing anyone else in, that was clearly against regulation. Zeke, man...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|We'll also need to fix the two doors that you Builders and the Mayor used to enter and exit the place.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|So, whaddya say, you in?}}

*''Yeah of course!''
*''I've got a lot on my plate...''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Yeah of course!
|I was gonna have Rian do the Ladder, but you know him, I ain't gonna get anything back until a couple of seasons later because this is "extra work."}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|So I turn to you. Once you have the recipe, I think you're supposed to build it on your Worktable. Install it outside the {{textcolor|green|Shipwreck Ruins}} after you're done. You know the drill by now, right?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|As for the doors, just bring some materials, I'm sure you can do your thing on site.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Anyway, thanks a bunch, it's nice to be able to depend on someone reliable.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=I've got a lot on my plate...
|Ah.. alright. I can wait a bit, we don't have a lot of ruin divers around anyway. Just let me know once you're free, OK? If you really don't have time, I'll get another Builder to help.}}
