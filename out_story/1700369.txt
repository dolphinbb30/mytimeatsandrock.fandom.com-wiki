If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|83761|Don't tell my boss I'm here for Luna's performance. He thinks I'm taking care of my sick grandpa...}}
{{dialogue|83762|I follow Luna wherever she goes. Got my camera ready for a close-up.}}
{{dialogue|83763|Hey, ya interested in buyin' some of Luna's photos? You can get 'em signed by her. That's my plan. Means I'll have autographed photos real soon, but they'll be like twenty times more expensive than just regular photos, and that's if they ain't all booked up.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Luna came by and picked up some of my ceremics. She seemed really into them. It's nice to be recognized, whether by a celebrity or not.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Wait, Luna is Ernest's sister? That's unfair... So much talent in one family! Unless talent just runs in the family? Darn, that means I must have some top-notch bandit skills myself!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Why didn't I know Luna was Ernest's sister? Do they look alike? Well, now that I think about it, they do have the same eyes...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|What did ya say? That Luna gal's a singer? Y'all mean she's a star or somethin'? Well, reckon it's 'bout time for ol' Coogo to have another music-off, if she's up for the challenge!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I knew someone in college who was a huge Luna fan. She had that same feisty and sparkly personality, and she was really passionate about archeology. But then her parents transferred her to the economics department, and I never saw her again.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Luna is so pretty and her voice is beautiful! Her performance was just... wow! It's so different from Coogo's. I'm officially a fan from now on!}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Luna is such a sweet kid. How is she adjusting to Sandrock? The weather here can be tough on her voice. I'll make some herbal teas for her, just in case.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Luna has been dining here every day since she arrived, and even ordering takeouts when she couldn't make it. I guess she loves the food in Sandrock, huh? She even gave me an autograph, which I framed and put up over there. Great for business!}}
