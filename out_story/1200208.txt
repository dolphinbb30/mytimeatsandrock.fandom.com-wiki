{{dialogue|Burgess|I came by to ask you to fill out a survey; it's something the Church give to all newcomers, very standard procedure. Care to take a moment to fill it out?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Ah hah, I see how it is... Trying to get a sample of my handwriting so you can impersonate me, eh!?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Gosh, no! Why... that would be illegal!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|You sure seem to know a lot about illegality...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Well, of course I do! It's a big part of my job!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Hah, so you admit it! illegality is a big part of your job because you're a bandit who does illegal things!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|N... No! C-could that be true? Have I been a bandit all along!?}}

*''No, Burgess. You're not a bandit.''
*''Looks like you found your spy, Bronco.''
*''Leave'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=No, Burgess. You're not a bandit.
|reward={{NPC2|Burgess|rp=7}}|But how can you be so sure, ''Player''... This man makes such a convincing case against me! Maybe I was projecting my ARCs status onto other people!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|Yeah, just think about it for a second, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Looks like you found your spy, Bronco.

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|The true- Sorry, what's your name again?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Burgess, sir!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|The true Burgess is a slimy villain, sitting high and mighty from atop his water tower, always plotting the next move for the Logan gang. That's right, we've found the mastermind right here!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Now tell me, why'd you do it? Why'd you attack the water tower?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I didn't!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Liar!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|All these things you're saying I did... I... I don't remember any of it...}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Ah hah... so you have a split personality... An evil... What was your name again?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Burgess, sir!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|An evil bandit Burgess that sleeps beneath the surface of an otherwise ordinary citizen...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Oh no!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Start talking now, Bur... Bernard... Berry...? ...Bingo! And maybe we can get you off with an insanity plea!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|O...okay!}}

*''Stop doing this to Burgess. He's not a bandit.''
*''Don't let him off easy, Bronco.''

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Stop doing this to Burgess. He's not a bandit.
|reward={{NPC2|Burgess|rp=7}}|Hmph. You're lucky, Bingo. Lucky you've got friends in high places. But without the Builder here, "jail time" would be your name-o, you hear me?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|I... Yes?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Don't let him off easy, Bronco.
|reward={{NPC2|Burgess|rp=7}}|Oh, you can bet your Furnace, Builder. Bronco always gets his man!}}
