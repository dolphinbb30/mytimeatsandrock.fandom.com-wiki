Title: Mettlesome Militia Make Mincemeat of Meddlesome Marauders
In one of the greatest upsets in modern history, Sandrock has emerged victorious in the battle against Duvos.

In the end, the water crisis was all just a cover-up for the real conspiracy: for years, Duvos had been planning to steal valuable relics from the Northern Plateau Ruins once thought to be inaccessible due to hazardous substances.

This turned out to be a lie as well; former members of the Church of the Light turned criminal, Matilda and Pen, began spreading this rumor years ago after Howlett discovered the ruins on one of his once famous monster hunting expeditions. 

It is with a heavy heart we discover the true nature of Howlett's untimely passing. Authorities have told us that as Howlett was returning home to report of his findings, he was intercepted by one of the Duvos operatives, who rendered him unconscious. He was then administered with an infectious virus used to sell the story that the Northern Ruins were to be avoided.

Howlett was a brave man who loved this town, squandered as a political tool by Duvos to further their military power. Let us not forget him, what he stood for, or the sacrifice he unwillingly made. And let this also be a reminder as to the sinister actions of our enemies and what they are capable of.

War is hell. Make no mistake. But some solace can be taken in the fact that from such misery can emerge heroes who delivered us from darkness. One such hero is ''Player''. Leading the charge over the canyon to the Northern Ruins, ''Player'' was accompanied by Sheriff Justice, Deputy-in-training Unsuur, and Deputy Captain Cat who fought their way to the center of the Duvos operation, stopping them dead in their tracks and saving the relics to be kept in the Free Cities, where they belong. 

The heroism of Atara Central Intelligence cannot go unthanked either. One of their agents had been investigating the Duvos plot all the way up 'til it came to a head with the recent conflict. It is only because of ACI intervention that we were able to prepare for the battle, and ultimately, their contributions were essential in our victory. 

Sandrock itself remains relatively unscathed, as we pick ourselves back up and prepare for a new era. With our enemies defeated and confidence at an all time high, I believe that our worst days are behind us, and soon Sandrock will be entering a golden age.
