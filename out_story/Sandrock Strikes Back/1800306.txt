{{dialogue|Avery|This attack was a blatant breach of our cease fire. Rest assured, Duvos will answer for what they've done here.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|You want to hit 'em back? That'll mean war...}}
{{dialogue|Avery|The Alliance values peace above all else, and has no intention of provoking war. However, we have never and will never back down from a fight...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Good to hear! Say, commander... I don't suppose you could take a few of these criminals off our hands? Our jail only seats six comfortably and... well, we gotta uphold our own standards, else we're no better than they are!}}
{{dialogue|Avery|We will stay in Sandrock briefly to prosecute any other missions Mayor Trudy has in mind for us. Then we'll leave with all Duvos prisoners, including the war criminal Pen. Everything will be smooth, so long as we're not interrupted.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Smooth as Yakmel butter, that's how we do it around here! Let us know if we can help.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|I said "so long as we're not interrupted..."}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Stay out of your hair. Gotcha...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Commander, has your company received any ACI orders?}}
{{dialogue|Avery|Official orders have not been received. However, it has become clear to me that you have been in clear violation of a 735; which warrants an evaluation by your superiors.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|That's funny, I thought I was up for a Medal of Honor...}}
{{dialogue|Avery|There are no medals awarded for backtalk. Return to Atara at once and take it up with your superiors.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Grace is headed out? Dang, that's right... I forgot she wasn't part of the Sandrock crew for a minute there...}}

{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Pen! You can be extra rough with him...''
*''What kind of punishment will Pen receive?''
*''We'll miss you, Grace!''
*''Won't you stay, Grace?''
*''What about Miguel and Yan?''
*''That's all. No questions.''

{{dialogue|Avery|indent=true|answer=Pen! You can be extra rough with him...
|I see. You must really hate him.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|indent=true|I understand. But as your commanding Civil Corps officer here said, we must uphold certain standards. He will be dealt with. But in a way that is neither cruel or unusual, even though we all know such scum deserves far worse...}}
{{dialogue|Avery|indent=true|answer=What kind of punishment will Pen receive?
|Pen was integral in the subterfuge against Sandrock and a leader in the attempted theft of Alliance relics. Rest assured, he will be held accountable to the full extent of the law. I'll make sure of that personally.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|indent=true|Pen is not only a senior officer of the Duvos army, he has a criminal record on and off the battlefield. He has taken countless lives and surely would've taken more if not for you all. He'll get what's coming to him.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=We'll miss you, Grace!
|Hey! Well... don't miss me yet, I haven't received the order. I expect they'll want me around for at least a little longer to oversee things as a rep from the ACI.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Well, certainly you wouldn't mosey before goin' on one last ride, would you?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Wouldn't dream of it.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Won't you stay, Grace?
|You know, I'd like to. Maybe I even can. First step is headed back to HQ to report on what's happened here...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|From there, well, who knows...?}}
{{dialogue|Avery|indent=true|answer=What about Miguel and Yan?
|Those two... As citizens of the Alliance, they fall under local jurisdiction.}}
{{dialogue|Avery|indent=true|The corrupt commissioner will be held here while he is investigated formally by the Free Cities Commerce Guild, and subsequently, replaced.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=That's all. No questions.
|Thank you again, Commander Avery, for your timely arrival. City Hall will be cooperating with you as best as we can also.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Next, Commander Avery, I believe you had some commendations you wanted to give out? To award those who went above and beyond the call of duty in uprooting the Duvos conspiracy against Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|The first person we'd like to recognize is... you, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Not only did you help mount our defenses against unfathomable odds, you led the charge into enemy territory, all for the good of our people and the citizens of the Alliance!}}
