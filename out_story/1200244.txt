{{dialogue|Justice|Howdy, y'all. Ahem. Following the... involuntary minister misplacement incident, the Minister raised... concerns . Concerns about {{textcolor|green|certain water-related allegations}} laid out by Logan, and, well, we're here to put any doubts to rest.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Our latest investigation was spearheaded jointly by Minister Matilda and Mayor Trudy, and carried out by myself and Unsuur of the Civil Corps. Without further ado, allow me to release our reports to the public.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Firstly, Unsuur and I made a full check of the perimeter, a thorough search of the area around Sandrock, leaving no stone unturned.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I made double sure of that.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Right... Anyway, beyond a certain distance, it just doesn't make much sense to continue looking around outdoors; transporting the water in and out of town, well, we'd have caught that on standard patrols by now.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|From there, we moved on to investigating individuals.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|After a series of interviews and crosschecking data, we have once again confirmed that civilian consumption of water is indeed very close in line with numbers reported by Burgess at the Water Tower: consistent at {{textcolor|green|twenty tons per month}}.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|So that's kinda all she wrote. On a positive note, we also found that, for the most part, everyone was being really careful with water consumption. So, uh, hope y'all can take a bit of solidarity in knowing that we're all out here, doing our best for Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Look at you all! Conservers, conservin' it uuup!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|With that, I'm going to turn things over to Pastor Miguel who also wanted to say a few words. Pastor, tell us what you know.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|With pleasure.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|The first thing I wish to assert is transparency. I'm making all import and export records publicly available. If you want to check said records, you'll find that: eighty percent of all water is imported, and twenty percent comes from the oasis so as not to put a strain on it.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|And now for the specifics...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Sandrock imports sixteen tons of water every month from two sources: Highwind via the east rail, and Portia through Atara. Another four tons comes from the oasis. Justice himself has checked the levels every step of the way, and has confirmed that at no point has there been any tampering.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Can you confirm that, please, sheriff?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yep, sounds about right. We looked into every in and out of the process at random times throughout the last few weeks and it all checked out.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Good. And, to be frank, my past performance speaks for itself. There has not been a single accounting error in Sandrock history since my arrival here. To even suggest that suddenly I've lost my touch is an insult. Good day.}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|It is... a very compelling report...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well... if that's the way it is, that's the way it is! All we can do is trust each other, because each other is all we have. Let's continue to do our best in fighting for Sandrock, together! And I think it goes without saying...}}
