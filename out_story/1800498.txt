{{dialogue|Burgess|I've been cleaning the oasis for years... it's even kind of relaxing!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|You're minister now, Burgess. There is no need for you to take on such menial tasks.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Uh, uh, uh! I'm there on Sundays telling people to do what they say, and what kind of minister would I be telling people to clean up the town if I'm not out here myself, bag in hand?}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|To find one who acts as they preach is a rarity. In my madness I think I had overlooked your virtues.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Logan did bad things, but he was doing what was right, and we forgave him! As we should! Your mind was all fuzzy, you thought you were doing right, but hoo-boy were you wrong!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|But I knew you could snap out of it. You never stopped believing in the Light.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|It is touching that you held such hope for me. It is true that my belief never faltered, although misplaced...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Welp. Now you get to see what you were missing out on all these years, out here pickin' up trash with the cool kids!}}
