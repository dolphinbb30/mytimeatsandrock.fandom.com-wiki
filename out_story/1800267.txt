{{dialogue|Cooper|Hey, wait a sec! Yer just gonna let this fella waltz back into town? Logan might've been integral in unravellin' a deep seated conspiracy that was a threat to the survival of our nation, but this ain't justice! He blew up our Water Tower back when!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|No, I didn't.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Y... Yeah! Well...! I mean... okay!? But you still did hijack the train! And kidnap the Minister!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Logan is now cooperating with Sandrock authorities and will be dealt with accordingly.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Throw the book at me, Trudes...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|More important to address are the shocking revelations that have come to light today, all before our very eyes. We have fallen victim to a Duvos plot.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|It is with a heavy heart I must admit that I, too, have been fooled. Pen and Miguel... were never who we believed them to be.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Take solace in the fact that no lives were lost today. I've received news from Fang that our Minister's condition is stable. Let us pray for her to make a speedy recovery.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|But make no mistake. This was an act of aggression. Our lives in the Free Cities may soon be very different.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We may have uprooted the corruption laying among us, but it hardly seems plausible that Duvos's singular goal was to dry up Sandrock. Regrettably, we must expect more. {{textcolor|green|If not here, elsewhere in the Free Cities.}}}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I intend to speak with our Representative Gregorcyk immediately and will inform you all as soon as possible what the Alliance advises that we do.}}
