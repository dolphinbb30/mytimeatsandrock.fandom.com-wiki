{{dialogue|Matilda|First order of business: it's true! Our Civil Corps and Builders were able to disperse the Geeglers in a surprise operation! In the process, the Shonash Canyon Bridge was destroyed.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|All parties involved performed bravely up against great odds, and ultimately, their actions led to the safety of Sandrock amidst the very real threat of invasion from the Geeglers!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|The most difficult days are behind us, but our job is not done. Before more water can be shipped to us from Portia and Atara, we need to {{textcolor|green|rebuild the railway bridge}}, pronto!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|I have asked Heidi to head this enormous effort. It'll be a difficult undertaking for her and her team.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|City Hall doesn't have enough budget or stores to ensure a speedy completion. We have reached out to the Alliance for help, but we cannot entrust our future to handouts.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|And so, I ask my fellow Sandrockers to help in any way you can. Be it construction materials or money. I have already directed the Church to give as much as we could.}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|Arvio and I have been arguing; let's just say I'm disappointed in his lack of enthusiasm for this bridge project...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Donate? Gosh... Ah... Well, here's my plan; I'm going to wait a little bit and just see who else donates. If it looks like you guys really need my help, I'm totally in!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Our teachings instruct us to always give to those in need! And who's more in need right now than... us?}}

{{dialogue|Catori|I'd donate to the bridge fund if I had any Gols to spare. I mean, I suppose I could take out another loan, but... if I keep missing payments, I'm pretty sure they're going to send someone after me at this point...}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Well... I s'pose... If'n I cancelled my subscription to the Tumbleweed Standard, I could stand to donate a bit to our cause... Not like I can read it anyway, but... dagnabbit how I would miss lookin' at all them pictures!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|How's the bridge going? Started yet? How can I help? I think it's gonna take a while, but in the meantime, how are we going to get water...}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I'm keen to donate some stuff to the bridge! I've got Yakmel Horns, Yakmel Fur, Fertilizer... you know, bridge stuff!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|You know, the care package from my grandma never arrived, and I ran out of pocket money... I mean...uh, my advance. If I had it, you wouldn't need to donate.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|You guys want me to donate to the bridge fund, huh? Tell Owen to give me a raise, then we'll talk!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey there, ''Player''! You wouldn't believe how many people are pitchin' in on our bridge fund! That's the Sandrock spirit!}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|I'll be makin' sure you all get plenty of good metal for that bridge! But don't think it's all outta the goodness of my heart or nothin'; I'm just assurin' my daughter's got what she needs to succeed!}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|I was gonna give you guys my lunch money but... I'd rather have lunch than a bridge.}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I called in a favor from the higher ups; expect to see a pretty sizable donation from the Free Cities Rail Co.! Er... Wait, I think that was supposed to be a secret. This conversation never happened!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|I mean, I could donate to the bridge fund, but seein' as my pay comes out of City Hall in the first place, all seems a bit redundant to me.}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|This bridge is important for Sandrock, and everyone's gotta do their part. If our hearts ain't in it enough, then it ain't gonna go well. When I'm home, I gotta make sure I'm pushin' the right spirit into 'em!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|We have been a bit strapped for cash these days, but like Minister Matilda says, "Every little bit helps!" So we did end up scroungin' up a bit to put in the donation box. You should too, if you haven't already!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|These have been tumultuous times since your arrival, but there is Light at the end of the tunnel, yet! Or perhaps, just across the bridge!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Whew. You gotta admit, these Sandrockers really know how to rally when things get tough! Guess they're used to it, huh...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|I do recommend donating to the bridge fund; once the project is finished, you'll be compensated, likely earning some percentage of what's left in the budget... Good optics, and it won't hardly cost you a dime...}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Our wills unite to create a fortress- only in this way can we weather the storm to come. This is who we are here, like our namesake, one grain of sand, one single stone, on their own are nothing, but together they can shake the earth!}}

{{dialogue|Owen|How much did I donate? Er... ''Player'', you know, I don't really like to brag... hah... Don't worry about what other people are doing, just do the best you can do!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Of all the lousy times to come back to this town, I can't afford to be here during such turmoil! My savings aren't like the sands of the desert, something that can be scooped up by the handful! They're more like... stray eyebrow hairs to be delicately tweezed...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|I'm afraid I don't have anything to spare for the bridge fund. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to have designer protein powder shipped in from Vega 5 on the reg? Well, just trust me. It's better this way.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Donate money to the bridge? Hm... I think I have a better idea. A much, much better idea... Indeed...}}

{{dialogue|Rian|I don't really make that much from my carpentry, but I'm donating, like, pretty much all I can. There's still a little left for the kid comin'...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Ey, yo! Builder! Good luck with the bridge! Me an' my boys are gonna make sure some good ores and stuff come your way! Don't ever say Eufaula Salvage never done nothin' for ya!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I donated my whole paycheck to the bridge fund. I don't really use money for anything, anyway.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Never count out Sandrock! Whenever it looks like we're goin' down, we always find a way to keep it together. Good luck with that bridge; just do whatever Heidi says and everything'll be hunky-dory!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Don't be afraid to cut corners on that bridge, ''Player''. If we can stay under budget, the Commerce Guild picks up whatever's in the pool when all's said and done! For example, why use an Iron Rivet when a Copper Screw will do? When you're in the Workshop, just think, "What would Yan do?"}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|I'd donate to the bridge thing, but... y'know I sell my veggies for practically nothin' so... good luck.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Donate money to the bridge? Hm... I think I have a better idea. A much, much better idea... Indeed...}}

{{dialogue|Rian|I don't really make that much from my carpentry, but I'm donating, like, pretty much all I can. There's still a little left for the kid comin'...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Ey, yo! Builder! Good luck with the bridge! Me an' my boys are gonna make sure some good ores and stuff come your way! Don't ever say Eufaula Salvage never done nothin' for ya!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|I donated my whole paycheck to the bridge fund. I don't really use money for anything, anyway.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Never count out Sandrock! Whenever it looks like we're goin' down, we always find a way to keep it together. Good luck with that bridge; just do whatever Heidi says and everything'll be hunky-dory!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Don't be afraid to cut corners on that bridge, ''Player''. If we can stay under budget, the Commerce Guild picks up whatever's in the pool when all's said and done! For example, why use an Iron Rivet when a Copper Screw will do? When you're in the Workshop, just think, "What would Yan do?"}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|I'd donate to the bridge thing, but... y'know I sell my veggies for practically nothin' so... good luck.}}
