Title: Sudden Sandstorm Strikes Sandrock!
It comes as no surprise to most of y'all, but here's a little heads up for the new folk around town:

Yes, you're in a sandstorm! No, it's not the end of the world! Yes, there will be more in the future. No, you shouldn't walk around with your mouth open.

On behalf of City Hall: we STRONGLY RECOMMEND that everyone STAY INSIDE during the sandstorms; it's not just the unpleasantries of the weather, but there have been known to be LARGE MONSTERS that roam around, so be warned!

If you must go out, please wear your Sand Gear at all times.

For commissions: you all know the drill by now. Any items needing replacement can be posted on the Commission Board. If things get bogged down at the Commerce Guild, you may ask Builders directly to help out, but Builders are not required to accept these informal requests.

Everyone stay safe, and may the Light always find you.
