{{dialogue|Qi|On the front is a custom Rotavator, capable of churning any terrain. And on the back, an all purpose Multidirectional Spray! Impressive huh? Here, these are the diagrams.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|...It's so beautiful...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Ahem, I hereby declare the Mobile Suit Mode: F to be fully operational! We did it ''Player''! The bureaucrats and the botanists will be so impressed.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|But now... Now the question is who among us will pilot this perfection? Perhaps a competition? For science, of course.}}

*''You're not afraid this time?''
*''I can definitely drive it better than you!''
*''I don't know how to pilot!''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=You're not afraid this time?
|Ahem... operating an Air Canon during a war and piloting a Mobile Suit Mode: F are not at all the same thing. Anyway, I believe the two of us are the only ones qualified to pilot it, after what happened to it during the tunnel project...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I can definitely drive it better than you!
|I don't doubt your skills, but I too, possess considerable determination.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I don't know how to pilot!
|Piloting a Mobile Suit is not about skill, it is about determination and attitude. You need to be one with the machine, let it be an extension of your body... ahem.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|But I still think it's better for us to compete, and see who can pilot it best. It seems the most fair.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Regardless, Mode: F is operational, so if you're ready, we can start the pilot test, right now. Mayor Trudy can select the pilot of the Mobile Suit.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Uhm Director... do we really need to do this...? We're just using it to plant trees faster... right?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Mayor, when you asked me for upgrades, I agreed. Why? Because it's my dream to pilot a Mobile Suit! In peace time, there are very stringent rules in place for this to happen, and I must observe them! Or else the very fabric of authenticity would be shattered!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|What... rules? Are they from Vega 5?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|They're... just there, okay? Are you going to stand between a man and his dream...?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Uh... no- fine. Let's just get this over with... Are you both ready?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Mayor, for the questions, please use the "Mobile Suit Code of Practice" issued by... Vega 5.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Right...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Okay, I'm prepared, ''Player'', are you?}}

*''Let's do it!'' (No unique dialogue)
*''I'll do my best...'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Trudy|Alright, question one: If you encounter pedestrians walking in front of you while piloting the Mobile Suit, you should?}}

*''Prepare for battle.''
*''Take a detour.''
*''Slow down to avoid collision.''
*''Speed up.''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Prepare for battle.
|Uh... ''Player'', I didn't expect you to be so... bold.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Take a detour.
|Good. Public safety is a priority.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Slow down to avoid collision.
|Good. Public safety is a priority.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Speed up.
|Uh... ''Player'', I didn't expect you to be so... bold.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|And Qi?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|There are no options available that fit with the adequate response. I would engage a power jump and avoid the situation entirely.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well that is certainly... not in the answers... but okay...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Next question. This is a picture question: If you are the pilot of the green Mobile Suit, what should you do in the given situation?}}

*''Decelerate and let the red Mobile Suit overtake.''
*''Take out your weapon and make them reverse through force.''
*''Turn on Action Mode and put the pedal to the metal.''
*''Avoid a collision and report to the authorities.''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Decelerate and let the red Mobile Suit overtake.
|I agree, safety first, no matter what the other suit's doing.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Take out your weapon and make them reverse through force.
|Ahem... this isn't the, uh... recommended... course of action...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Turn on Action Mode and put the pedal to the metal.
|Ahem... this isn't the, uh... recommended... course of action...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Avoid a collision and report to the authorities.
|I agree, safety first, no matter what the other suit's doing.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|And you, Director?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|There isn't an option here that is appropriate, either.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Of course...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I would engage Action Mode and then stop in front of the other Mobile Suit and explain the rules they were violating.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|But wouldn't you run into them based on this scenario?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Actually, I would be in Action Mode while engaging the power jump from the previous question, thus completely avoiding a collision.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Oh... kay...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, that ends the theory aspect of the exam. Now we are going to start the operational exam. We'll begin with ''Player'', please take your place on the Mobile Suit.}}
