{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey, ''Player''! Guess what's coming up? Hint: it's a very special day...!}}

*''Someone's birthday?''
*''Your birthday?''
*''A Fireside chat?''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Someone's birthday?
|Ah hah! You're right! How did you know? Are you some kind of birthday remembering master?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Your birthday?
|reward={{NPC2|Arvio|rp=-3}}|Ah... it's not. You... don't know when my birthday is...? Well, I'll try not to take that too personally...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=A Fireside chat?
|Ahah, the Fireside... is that something you hold dear? You sure take your civic responsibilities seriously! I dig it.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|In fact, it's my sister's birthday! She didn't tell you? Haha, that is so her.}}

*''I'm pretty sure it's not...''
*''I didn't know!''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I'm pretty sure it's not...
|Haha! Come now, I'm her brother! Oh, that's right! Maybe you're not familiar with our Barnarock traditions.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|You see, a while back, we all got together and thought, "One birthday per year is good, why don't we just make it two?" And thus, the custom of a birthday-plus was born!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|You just take the original birthday, add three months, divide by the letters in their name, then... ah... carry the two, and, well, the important thing is: it's right around the corner!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I didn't know!
|Yeah, it's really soon! So if you don't know... now you know!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Oh, that's right! It's not her real birthday. It's a special tradition from back home!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|You see, a while back, we Barnarockers all got together and thought, "One birthday per year is good, why don't we just make it two?" And thus, the custom of a birthday-plus was born!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|You just take the original birthday, add three months, divide by the letters in their name, then... ah... carry the two, and, well, like I said, it's right around the corner!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Since we've been doing better than back in Barnarock, I thought we could splurge a bit for the occasion and have a masquerade party! You know? Like the ones written in old books!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Have you ever read about them? Everyone wears masks and fancy clothes, then they dance the night away! I've always wanted to try one out in real life.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|My costume is still a work in progress... I'm torn between my desire to be mysterious and my need to also stand out! The struggle is quite real.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|In any case, you simply must come! You'd be the guest of honor!}}

*''Yeah, I'll come!''
*''I'm really busy...''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I'll come!
|Ah hah! Piqued your interest, have I? Good! In fact, I was so sure you'd come that I designed a mask for you myself! Pablo helped. A little. Here's the recipe!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|I really would be just delighted if you were to wear that to the masquerade! Oh, speaking of which... Masquerade! My place! See you there, ''Player''! You won't regret it!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I'm really busy...
|You really can't come? A birthday-plus only comes once a year!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Well, do let me know if you get time! This masquerade just wouldn't be the same without you! One might even say that I planned this whole thing with you in mind... But not to worry! I'll figure something out.}}
