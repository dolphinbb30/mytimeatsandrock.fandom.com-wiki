{{dialogue|Trudy|What do you mean exactly when you said that {{textcolor|green|"you refuse to believe there's not something to be had here?"}}}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Well, I have a bit more planned than what I've made public... You all are here, smack dab {{textcolor|green|in the middle of the continent}}. Let's say... if I were ever to build some sort of central hub for land transportation, it'd be right here where I'm standing.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|It makes sense logistically, for trade and, if it ever came to it, {{textcolor|green|war as well}}...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|The Alliance of Free Cities has limited population but makes up a lot of territory; that's a weakness. If push ever comes to shove, we need to be able to move supplies around as quickly as possible.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Every second lost could mean the difference between victory and defeat in another potential war against Duvos...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|And, when I saw how you all handled yourselves, well, that just sealed the deal for me. The truest test of character is seeing people when things are at their worst.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Very sound, very insightful, Mr. Musa. It means a lot to have your support, especially with it being so well thought out. If I may ask, where did you learn to think like this? It's all so... macro.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|School of hard knocks, Ms. Heidi...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Huh?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|I'm sure your Mayor went to that school as well.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Uh huh...}}
