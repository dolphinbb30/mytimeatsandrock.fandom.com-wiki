The player can begin the mission by speaking to the following character:

{{dialogue|Owen|Oh, hey! Need anything?}}

*''Actually, I'm kinda broke...''
*''I'm fine, thanks, though.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Actually, I'm kinda broke...
|Haha, hey, I hear ya! Here, take my tip jar for the day! Just a little something to get you back on your feet. No strings attached!}}

:*''Thanks, buddy! {{textcolor|green|【Borrow 500 Gols from Owen】}}''
:*''Oh, no, really, I couldn't...''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=Thanks, buddy! {{textcolor|green|【Borrow 500 Gols from Owen】}}
|It's not easy being a stranger in a strange land... but we've got a saying in Sandrock: a stranger's just a friend you haven't met! Everybody's got each other's back here, and you're one of us now, so that means you, too!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|Pay me back, eh, whenever... or don't! It's all gravy. Just always make sure you have enough to be comfortable and eat right, you know? Stop by the saloon anytime if you ever need some help, alright?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=Oh, no, really, I couldn't...
|Are you sure? Well, offer's on the table!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I'm fine, thanks, though.
|Whatever you say! Well, if you ever do need anything, you know where I'll be!}}
