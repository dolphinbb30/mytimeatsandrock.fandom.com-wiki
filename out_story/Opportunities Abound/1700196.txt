{{dialogue|Yan|Madam Catori, when you work with the Commerce Guild of Sandrock, you're working with a name you can trust. Our motto is, "Truth, honesty, integrity, and eh-"}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Ah, what a coincidence! If it isn't the hardest working Builder in Sandrock! Lovely Catori, if you please, allow my subordinate to make your acquaintance. Bridges, Hydrogels, jerky, our star Builder, ''Player'', does it all!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Er, yes, I believe I'm familiar-}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Yes, yes... ''Player'' and Mi-an were total newbies when they first came to Sandrock, but under my wing, they've flourished into... oldbies! Top workshop owners, known even across the Free Cities!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|No matter the size or difficulty of your project, I'm boastfully confident my brilliant Builders won't bungle it! You tell them yourself, ''Player''!}}

*''I do okay.''
*''I am the greatest!''
*''Better than this guy here.''

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=I do okay.
|So modest! ''Player'', they're far better than okay! Pretty okay, one might even say!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=I am the greatest!
|Eh, well... I dunno about that. Greatest? Let's go with "pretty okay!" "Good," even. Maybe.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Better than this guy here.
|Ahahah! Good one, ''Player''! Yes, see Madam Catori, us at the Commerce Guild are all thick as theives; we like to rib each other a bit, have a little bit of playful banter...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|You're horrible and I hate you and your yard is extremely ugly, really do something about it, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|Ahahah... see? It's just a little thing we do. A funny bit! But on the job, we're all business, I can assure you.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Of course, like I was saying, I'm familiar with the quality of their work, happy to have 'em. Let's uh, get back on topic?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Ah hah! Yes, a true businesswoman, you are! Back to the heart of the matter: and may I say, it's really an honor for our guild to receive such a striking commission from such a striking client...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Er, well, the short of it is, I'm planning on expanding the Golden Goose Gaming Extravoplaza! Right now we only have like two games! Who would want to come to Sandrock just to visit a dinky shack like what I got now...?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Now, now, don't say that! Your game center is known across the land already for its, uh... splendid... woodiness!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Yeah! It is rather, uh, well, it's fine... But the competition out there is vicious! We can't get left behind! That's why we gotta expand, renovate... start paving the way towards the future!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Oh, yes, future. You've gotta have that! Let's talk specifics, then: what exactly are you hoping to have built in this expansion project?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Well, I'm gonna need a new {{textcolor|green|store front}}, a new {{textcolor|green|sign}}, start a catalog of {{textcolor|green|new games}}...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|My! What big dreams you have for your Extravoplazer... thing! Before I forget, perhaps we ought to first discuss one, teeny, tiny, minor, inconvenient little detail... How exactly will you be paying for all this?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Oh. Yeah. Well, I figured since this was such a sure thing, I could just promise you guys a portion of the profits once they roll in! It'll be real fair for all of us and-}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Um. Ooh. So, eh- What you're saying is...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|You don't... have the money...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|...For the project...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Er- well, in a matter of speaking... I guess you could say... I don't.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Uh-huh.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Goodness me! Well, I really hate to cut things short, but I really do have a lot of things on my plate right now, but don't worry, we can continue this conversation through the mail! Don't mail me, I'll mail you.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I-}}
{{dialogue|Yan|I was supposed to have my reports on their way to the Free Cities Commerce Guild ten minutes ago! Time sure does fly when you're... wasting time. Well, goodbye, now! Go on, scooch!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|But I- er, I'll... earnestly await your correspondence, Commissioner Yan... Goodbye.}}

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I mean, the business needs a mascot... And... Well, also it shows that I'm honest! Yeah, I mean, if I'm willing to put my face up there, it'll let people know that the rides are safe and stuff.}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Good! Welcome, everyone! It seems we're all here, so let's begin.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|First of all, welcome! You may all know me as Catori, the lady who purchased up the Golden Goose just after the peak of its success. Haha, ahem... But today, with just fifteen minutes of your time, I will present to you an idea that could change your life!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Behold!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Catori World! A vast and unabridged cavalcade of merriment and amusement: an unparalleled brand of entertainment!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|As we all know, Sandrock was once a beacon of prosperity in the ocean of a desert that is the Eufaula. Of course, at that time we were in the rather favorable position of middle-men.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|So to speak... Tens of thousands of people would transfer through Sandrock, and the Golden Goose was a favorite stop along the way for young and old!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|These days however... well, I don't think it would be an understatement to say that this town could do with some revitalization. And so... enter: Catori World! To chase the clouds away and bring prosperity to Sandrock once more!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|How will I do it, you might ask?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I will carry out the construction of a multi-dimensional, sensational, and all-around recreational set of entertainment facilities, including but not limited to a new and improved Game Center, larger Museum, and one day, {{textcolor|green|a theme park}}!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Before long, tourists will once again flock to Sandrock to view and partake of the exuberance that is the largest and most bountiful spot for entertainment in the Free Cities... Catori World!}}

*''I've heard enough. Yeah, I'm in!''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Could I lose money?
|Er... Well... Technically, yes, it is possible you could lose money... in the sense that anything is technically possible, so there may exist a universe where you did lose money but... Catori World! ....haha...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|Tell you guys what: if the first round of monthly dividends are not to your liking, if you're still not confident in the project, you can have all your money back, guaranteed!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=What do I need to do?
|Both you and Mi-an can invest through labor; provide construction services for my amusement and other facilities for the park, then I grant you a larger percentage of the profits! Builder work is essential to make this all happen.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=What can I get from this?
|I will send a seasonal report to all partners and attach the profit dividend of the season. The more work you do, the more Gols you get! Everything will be quite fair, real equitable-like. Even-steven!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Sandrock is falling apart, we should build up our town first...
|Yes, yes, Sandrock has its fair share of issues: the water thing, the bandit thing, the other... things... But look, when I first got here, I was taken in by the scenery! I was captivated! We just need to get people out here and they'll feel the same way!}}

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|This plan... it's a pie in the sky; But as long as it might help Sandrock, I'm interested, and will be happy to get involved with the start up process. We can talk more once we really start seeing more tourists in town.}}

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=double|Yes! Well, it's like they say, one can always depend on the heart of a child to make sound business decisions...! It means so much to have everyone's support... and this is definitely a 'more the merrier' type situation...}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Builder, once again, thank you for your support!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|As a matter of fact, I've got something for you already: game center renovations! A new sign, a new game, more floor space... the whole nine yards!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|The expansion will just be gathering materials, but you know how it is. Heidi doesn't cut corners. She'll need stuff only experienced divers like you could track down. Once we've got the materials, she'll handle the rest. Leaving the sign and new game machine...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|The new sign shouldn't be too much trouble, but this new game machine I got the diagram for... I'm no expert, but it looks like it's got some bells and whistles on it. But hey, nothing you can't handle, eh?}}

*''No problem at all!''
*''Bells and whistles you say...?''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=No problem at all!
|That's what I like to hear! It's like Musa says in his Twelve Steps to Success: the only chance you have to win is to believe you can win!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Bells and whistles you say...?
|Ah, yeah... a little complicated, but really, trust me, you've got this! Just don't forget to pace yourself; you can't let yourself get burned out just past the starting line!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Alright. Here are the diagrams. My hopes are that by expediting phase one, we'll garner some attention that'll lead to some profit for all of us right away! Once things take off, I can pay you double for this job! Er... probably!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|When you've got the materials give them to me, I'll get Heidi to handle the expansion. When she's done, just install the sign and the machine. Thanks again for believing in me, Builder! I won't let you down!}}
