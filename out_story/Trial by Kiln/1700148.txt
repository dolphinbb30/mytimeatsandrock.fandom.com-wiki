{{dialogue|Arvio|So? Shall I put you down for a dozen? Two?}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Hm! First, I must have a bit more information. Where did you get these? My goodness, the patterns, they're exquisite! I could sell these for a pretty penny over in Walnut Groove...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Hahaha! Why don't you take a guess? Get it right and maybe I'll give you a discount...}}

|Smooth operator? Are you... talking about me?}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|Eh. Yeah, no. Odd choice of words, Builder. Not very helpful. No matter! It's all coming together for me now anyway... Clearly it was the sister! And she used that kiln you got through me, no?}}

|Hahah! Exactly, it's the work of ''Player''! What a twist!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|Poppy-cock! Though you tried to mislead me, it's becoming clearer now... It must be none other than Miss Amirah with the aid of the new kiln!}}

{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Ahah, well, I must say I was just here admiring your new products and... Fine stuff! Very fine indeed! You really showed me! I was just discussing with your brother here about getting a discount on some of these goods...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|I'll start taking a few of these artworks down to Walnut Groove every month, and soon we'll all be just a little bit richer! Sounds good, doesn't it?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|No deal.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Wha?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|My sales have been fine lately. Thanks.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Ahah, look: perhaps I was a bit harsh before. It was cruel to suggest your popularity here has been due to your appearance. Clearly I was wrong! But don't let your pride get in the way of us all making money, I beg of you!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Okay then, just one question: if you really didn't have any confidence in my skills, why bother to sell us the diagram for such a reasonable price?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Oh! Was it the Mysterious Man's plan all along to get my sister worked up enough to have an artistic breakthrough? Or... did he just genuinely believe her work was bad before?}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|The Mysterious Man works in mysterious ways...}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Full price. No discount. We can start with a dozen for now. Final offer, take it or leave it.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|The offer is acceptable, and most generous. Thank you, Miss Amirah! You shan't regret this!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Miss Amirah, Mister Arvio, I'm a man of my word. I'm off to Walnut Groove, as promised. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement! And... congratulations on your newly realized skills, Miss Amirah!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Good luck out there...}}
