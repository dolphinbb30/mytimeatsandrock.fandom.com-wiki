{{dialogue|Arvio|It's got a lot of pot-ential! Surely this one is "mysterious" enough to add to your stock!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Please, call me the "Mysterious Man." Mr. Mysterious was my father's moniker. But, on the subject of mysteriousness, I'm afraid this pot could hardly be called mysterious enough for one such as myself. It's, at best, quizzical.}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|...How dare you. Get out.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Hey! Don't take it personally! Look. I've been around. I've seen the best! If I brought my guys from Walnut Groove in here to see this dull junk you're peddlin', they'd laugh their butts off at the mere notion that you're anything but an amateur!}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey! That's my sister's livelihood you're talking about there, pal!}}

{{dialogue|Amirah|...Indeed, I use a traditional kiln. Glazing requires a kiln with more advanced temperature controls.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|So you know all about it! What's your excuse then? Old ways are best?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|No. Money. And besides, though a traveler as yourself may have encountered such things, the more advanced kilns are rare, and their construction is still a well-guarded secret by masters within the ceramics community...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Well, if you're a true artist, go and seek one of these "masters" out! Get off your high horse and beg, if you must. 'Til then, I have no business being here, and you have no business acting as though I do!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Then you get one for me.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Why would I do that?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|You said "seek a master?" You're the so-called master of trade, who claims he can get any rare item from any rare place...}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Get me a new kiln and I'll prove to you that my ceramics are as good as anyone's in whatever "sky" it is you speak of.}}
