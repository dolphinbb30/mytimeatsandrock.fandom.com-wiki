{{dialogue|X|Story! Story!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Ha, well this isn't Saloon Night Live, but I'm always happy to accommodate my loyal listeners. I'd be glad to tell you one right now!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Once upon a time, there was a brave little Bumble Ant...}}
{{dialogue|X|Bird story! Bird story!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Oh, uh... a story about birds, huh? Well... I guess we all like to see a bit of ourselves in the narrative... let me think...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Alright, so this is a bit of a longer one. You know there's a kind of bird called the Mmm bird? It got it's unique name from the distinct sound it makes, similar to someone saying, "Mmm." It's relevant, but, uh... well, we'll get back to that...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The stage is set with a young thief being pursued. Under the cover of the following chaos, he hides under the window of a woman's boudoir.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The man stood by the woman's window, pleading with her not to scream, not to draw attention. The woman readily agreed. The thief, grateful for the assistance, couldn't help but return nightly, under the cover of darkness.}}
{{dialogue|X|Brawk! Bird story! Bird story!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Come on, don't interrupt... I'm getting there...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Anyway, this guy, he poured his heart out to her. Moving words, making even the coldest heart concede. She listened carefully, heeding his words with utterings of acceptance.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Now this man, he believed he had won over her heart. He truly felt his words had laid the foundation to true love. He took the final step, and confessed his love. The woman agreed without hesitation.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The man, pushed on by love, decided to propose. He went to the house, but the family were surprised. They were clueless, there was no woman in the window talking all night.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I think by now I need not say it, I'm sure you've guessed. In the window of the "boudoir," lived a caged Mmm bird. From beginning to end, the words of acceptance, were simply the utterings of a very unique bird...}}
{{dialogue|X|Wow, what a twist! Brawk! Aw, I saw it comin' from a mile away...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Well, can't please everybody...}}
