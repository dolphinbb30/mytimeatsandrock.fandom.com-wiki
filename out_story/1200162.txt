{{dialogue|Ernest|I guess just start off with an introduction, talk a little about yourself. Whatever comes to mind.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Um... I'm Trudy. I've lived in Sandrock my whole life. I was elected mayor here after my husband Theodore, the former mayor passed away during a sandstorm.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|As a citizen, I've watched Sandrock dwindle and nearly shrivel up. So now it's my job, no, my duty to keep this place alive!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|...Which I couldn't do without the help of all my lovely friends and colleagues, of course!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Good! Yeah, that's good stuff, we can use that. Alright, let's start with the questions.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|A lot of outsiders find the Sandrock mindset hard to understand. As you said, Sandrock is dwindling, but it seems like all of you still have the capacity to pick up and move somewhere more prosperous. Why not do that? Why stay in this town?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Wow. Gosh, that's... that's a complicated question to answer...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Well, try to keep it compact. You know how readers can be, no attention span these days...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|A... Alright...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, simply put: this place means something to us. For people like me, it's been a part of our lives since childhood. Everything we've ever experienced happened all around this oasis.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We do this for Martle, for Rhonda, Theodore... all the people we lost here. The people who loved this place no matter what. If we let Sandrock disappear, we let their memories fade with it... and allow their sacrifice to be... meaningless.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I won't let that happen.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Oh, s-sorry, was that too long? Maybe I can rephrase that...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|N-no! Ah, I just...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|That was... good! We can use that! Next question.}}
