{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Of course! Got it right here.
|Great. I have special plans for it.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Oh, no! I forgot!
|That's okay. I made another one we can use. Like Justice always says: "Always have a backup plan." Which in this case, is a rock.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I'm really glad you're here. Sometimes it feels like we never get to do stuff together. You're always building things, I'm always walking around looking for bad guys... I wish we had more time to do stuff like this instead.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|You may have noticed this extraordinary pile of rocks next to all the regular rocks that are usually here.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I chose them especially for our date tonight. You know I love to stack rocks in different ways. It's been a relaxing and a creative outlet for me.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Lately, I've also been thinking how everything I do is better when it's with you. Then, it hit me. If stacking rocks by myself is my favorite thing to do, doing it with you will be...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|The most. Favoritest. Thing. Ever.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|So here's my plan: I'll make part of this thing thinking about you and how happy I am when I'm with you. If you do the same, and finish the parts I left empty, then it'll be like... the rock version of our love.}}

*''Like a metaphor?''
*''It represents our love?''

{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Like a metaphor?
|Meta... wha?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=It represents our love?
|Huh?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|No, it is our love. In rock form.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Well, without further ado... Let's get this party started...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Ahem. Quick: what's your favorite color? But. You can only choose rufous or sepia.}}

*''Rufous.''
*''Sepia.''

{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Rufous.
|Rufous, same color as the head of a hornbill.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Sepia.
|Nice. Darker than brown, lighter than black.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Okay perfect. I was hoping you'd say that. Okay, next, what's your favorite shape? But. You can only choose mountain, heart, or... thumbs up. These are... the only shapes I know how to make...}}

*''Mountain.''
*''Heart.''
*''Thumbs up.''

{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Mountain.
|Ah hah. Mountain. Wise choice. That's the biggest rock there is. If we're gonna make a rock version of our love, go big or go home, am I right?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Heart.
|Ah, like a bigger version of the heart shaped rock. A sequel. If there's anything I know about anything, the world can always use more sequels.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=Thumbs up.
|That's what I was gonna pick. Our relationship gets a thumbs up from me. Five stars, would fall in love again.}}
