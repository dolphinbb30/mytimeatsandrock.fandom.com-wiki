{{dialogue|Grace|Anyone else or is he more anxiety inducing than the declaration of war?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Please keep your head on your shoulders, Director; this is not a chance for you to play mad scientist or... cartoon robots... or whatever else it is you might be thinking. We need effective countermeasures, and we need them fast.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes, yes, I'm familiar with how time works. At least... to the extent that anyone else in my field is...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|You will have the best I have to offer.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|That'll have to do...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|''Player'', {{textcolor|green|can you please speak with your cohort, Mi-an and tell her that you both now have one million things to build?}} The Commerce Guild no longer functions, as I understand it.}}

*''Sure thing.''
*''I can handle it myself!''
*''Maybe she can just take care of this one for me...''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I can handle it myself!
|Commendable attitude, but not exactly efficient.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Maybe she can just take care of this one for me...
|Mm. No... I can't really recommend that...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|''Player''... we need both of you Builders cranking out this stuff as fast as possible. The fate of Sandrock may very well depend on how you two perform.}}

*''I'll do my best.''
*''We'll show 'em Sandrock ain't nothin' to mess with!''
*''I'm worried...''

Title: Immoral Invaders Imminent! (Local only)
This is not a drill!

Sandrock Civil Corps has intercepted messages on an encoded telegraph channel revealing plans to attack Sandrock!

Repeat: this is not a drill!

The Duvos army is attacking!

Do not panic! If you wish to help, report to a local Civil Corps officer and ask for an assignment.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THOSE INTENDING TO LEAVE SANDROCK

-Do not attempt to leave the city alone. 
-Do not attempt to leave the city without an experienced traveler in your party.
-Clearly define roles in a party so there is no conflict of responsibility.
-Do not try to escape on main roads. Duvos' presence is unknown, they may be anywhere, but they will definitely be on main roads. Groups of soldiers may be lying in ambush or have set traps.
-Bring food, medicine, and other supplies. You don't know how long you'll be on the trail.
-Bring reading material.
-Plan your route with a map and compass.
-Travel at night, hide during the day.
-Avoid making camp anywhere with only one exit. Have an escape route in mind wherever you are.
-Communication in Sandrock is jammed, be aware that friendlies are not expecting you and you will need a way to identify yourself.
-Carry a "dummy wallet" in an accessible bag that has a medium sum of Gols as well as fake papers to hand over in a robbery.
-Pack all of your supplies before you sleep in case you need to make a quick getaway.

Good luck.

I believe in Sandrock!
