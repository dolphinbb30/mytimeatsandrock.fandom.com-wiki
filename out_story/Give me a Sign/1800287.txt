{{dialogue|Qi|Ah, greetings, ''Player''. Recovering well after the debacle over in town square, I hope? Yes, yes, I've heard all about it.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I like to keep myself informed on cataclysmic events occurring in our city-state. It is always good to be where the bullets are not.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|In any case, you handled yourself spectacularly, so I have heard. Truly impressive.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hm? A miniaturized triangulation device? And the reason you need to do so is: "it's a secret?"}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Fascinating. So there is more to this water thieving tale after all. Well, if you're sworn to secrecy, don't compromise your integrity by telling me. I will... find out on my own anyway.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Ah, if you hadn't guessed by my less than astonished reaction to your request, yes. I can help you. The technology already exists. In fact, my Grandpa made something similar to locate underwater relics a long time ago.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Allow me to explain...}}

*''Just the diagram, please.''
*''Go on, I'm curious.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Just the diagram, please.
|Really? You really came all this way to not learn something?}}

:*''Kind of in a hurry...''
:*''Oh, alright. Tell me.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=double|answer=Kind of in a hurry...
|Very well. That'll be 20 Data Discs...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=double|answer=Oh, alright. Tell me.
|Ahem!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=double|Of course, we could simply run a check on all frequencies being broadcast anywhere nearby, seek out the one in question, then build a highly directional large antenna that would lead us straight to the source.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=double|However, this depends on signals being sent out regularly, which, I feel I can fairly assume is not the case, being that this is a secret telegraph station.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=double|Therefore, we will need three highly directional large antennae.}}

::*''Ah hah! Triangulation! Right...?''
::*''So we don't have to share!''
::*''So they don't get lonely!''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|answer=Ah hah! Triangulation! Right...?
|Indeed, ''Player''. Showing understanding of a concept outside of your area of expertise; I'm impressed.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|Now for this next part, pay attention, try not to be obtuse.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|That was a bit of triangulation humor there for you, ''Player''. You see, an obtuse person would not be able to understand a concept as sophisticated as signal triangulation.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|You however, are someone who has never displayed any obtuse characteristics, therefore there was no reason for me to offer such a warning. That's the joke.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|Triangulating the signal will allow us to know where the source is within a roughly point two league radius, and all we will need is one outgoing signal to identify it.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|Oh? You know the frequency they operate on already? I see. Sometimes I feel like you have all the fun, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|Well. If you know the frequency, we'll just need to track an outgoing signal sometime after we have built and installed the three antennae.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|Setting up three tracers outside of the possible area where the station might be, registering the direction that the signal comes from at each of our locations will allow us to draw three lines on a map, that should all intersect...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|Directly on top of our secret telegraph station.}}

:::*''Bravo!''
:::*''The diagrams, please...?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=4|answer=Bravo!
|Rather elementary, ''Player''. Nothing you're unfamiliar with. I just thought it might be worthwhile to regale you with a world famous "Director Qi's thoroughly digestible scientific explanation." In case you need to explain it to someone... obtuse.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=4|Very well. That'll be 20 Data Discs...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=4|answer=The diagrams, please...?
|Hm. Yes. Apologies. Though I do have an encyclopedic knowledge of such subjects readily available off the cuff, I do need time to physically produce comprehensible diagrams...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=4|Very well. That'll be 20 Data Discs...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=3|answer=So we don't have to share!
|Hm. I had not yet considered that minor benefit. The essential purpose of having three antennae, however, is so that we might triangulate the signal in question.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Alright. So the message. {{textcolor|green|We need to be convincing.}} Let's start with...}}

*''This is Duvos HQ.''
*''This is Sandrock Base.''
*''This is the Emperor!''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=This is Duvos HQ.
|I agree. Surely they've sent and received messages with HQ, there should be no way for them to tell the difference between us and them. At least, not immediately.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=This is Sandrock Base.
|Eh... Pretend to send a telegram to... ourselves? And who says they even think of that place as "Sandrock Base," Anyway?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Let's say we're their HQ just checking in. I think that's as good as anything.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=This is the Emperor!
|Eh... do you think the emperor of Duvos really makes personal calls to his minor Sandrock operations? Let's just say we're... the broad concept of Duvos. We can let them make assumptions about who we are and just go with it.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|As for the {{textcolor|green|content}} of the message...}}

*''Report in.''
*''Tiger has been caught. Beware.''
*''New telegraph, who dis?''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Report in.
|Good idea. Vague enough that we won't arouse suspicion. Sounds... boss-ish. Plus, they might reply with something juicy if we're lucky.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Tiger has been caught. Beware.
|Hm. Points for being in character but... this is too good. It's what an actual Duvos agent might send them to warn them about what we're doing! Let's just go with something super vague like... ask them for a report or something.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=New telegraph, who dis?
|Ehhhh... I feel like... that's... not... how Duvos informs its secret operatives that it has new equipment. Let's just... ask for a report.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|...Blank check.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Blank check!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Anyone else or is he more anxiety inducing than the declaration of war?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Please keep your head on your shoulders, Director; this is not a chance for you to play mad scientist or... cartoon robots... or whatever else it is you might be thinking. We need effective countermeasures, and we need them fast.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes, yes, I'm familiar with how time works. At least... to the extent that anyone else in my field is...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|You will have the best I have to offer.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|That'll have to do...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|''Player'', {{textcolor|green|can you please speak with your cohort, Mi-an and tell her that you both now have one million things to build?}} The Commerce Guild no longer functions, as I understand it.}}

*''Sure thing.''
*''I can handle it myself!''
*''Maybe she can just take care of this one for me...''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I can handle it myself!
|Commendable attitude, but not exactly efficient.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Maybe she can just take care of this one for me...
|Mm. No... I can't really recommend that...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|''Player''... we need both of you Builders cranking out this stuff as fast as possible. The fate of Sandrock may very well depend on how you two perform.}}

*''I'll do my best.''
*''We'll show 'em Sandrock ain't nothin' to mess with!''
*''I'm worried...''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I'll do my best.
|That's all I could ask for.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=We'll show 'em Sandrock ain't nothin' to mess with!
|Dig that confidence.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I'm worried...
|We all are, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Alright. Let's get to it then.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Indubitably!}}
