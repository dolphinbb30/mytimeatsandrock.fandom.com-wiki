{{dialogue|Owen|Hey there, ''Player''! Got something on your mind?}}

*''Nah, how are things with you?''
*''Yeah, I want to sell you a recipe.''
*''Nope, was just leaving.''
*''How's your brother?''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I want to sell you a recipe.
|Haha, oh yeah? Straight to the point, huh? Alright! Let's hear it! ...Say, when'd you start cookin' up your own recipes, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|"Chaojimalatuoniu-" wha-? I dunno about that name, Seesaian, you say? Oh well, it's your recipe, I guess. I hope you can at least tell me it tastes better than it sounds!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Noodles? I dunno, I already got Spaghetti! And people can pronounce that... it's fun to say, even! Spaghetti! Try it some time when you're feelin' down...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Yeah, I think I'll pass. Thanks for the offer, though! You should keep cooking, maybe we can work on something together sometime. Catch ya, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Nope, was just leaving.
|Haha, well, if you're not busy, you know where to find me!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=How's your brother?
|Huh? I don't have a brother, ''Player''. What's gotten into you?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Oh! I get it... this must be some hip new way of asking someone how they're doing! Hah! See, I'm still pretty "with it," despite what Grace might tell you! How am I doin'? Lemme think...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Hm, well, actually we're in a bit of a slump lately... I think people are getting tired of the same ol' recipes. The Blue Moon special's not so special anymore, I guess you could say!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I've been back in kitchen trying to cook up something new and exciting, but so far it's been a no-go. If only there were someone out there, someone who could bring the spark of innovation back to my menu!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Hey, speaking of which: you got that Cooking Station not that long ago, right? How's that going? Need any tips? Haha!}}

*''I've been remaking common dishes...''
*''I have a recipe to sell you, in fact.''
*''Just tryin' not to start fires. See ya.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I have a recipe to sell you, in fact.
|Haha, oh yeah? Straight to the point, huh? Alright! Let's hear it! ...Say, when'd you start cookin' up your own recipes, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|"Chaojimalatuoniu-" wha-? I dunno about that name, Seesaian, you say? Oh well, it's your recipe, I guess. I hope you can at least tell me it tastes better than it sounds!}}

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Yeah, I think I'll pass. Thanks for the offer, though! You should keep cooking, maybe we can work on something together sometime. Catch ya, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Just tryin' not to start fires. See ya.
|Haha, well, if you're not busy, you know where to find me!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|...Oh yeah? Hm, you could be onto something. Everybody likes bread and rice and stuff. If you had some way to spice up the classics, yeah, that could be just the thing I need here at the saloon...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Well, don't leave me hangin' here! Surely you're not just spitballin', you've got something in mind, I can tell! C'mon, ''Player'', enough with the suspense, let's hear about your "secret recipe!"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Ah hah... A special blend of eighteen Seesaian peppers? I gotta admit, that sounds pretty hot... I didn't even know they had that many kinds of peppers. Alright, alright, what else? How do you make it?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The blend comes through the Mysterious Man, huh? I see how it is; you can't just give away a recipe like that. Alright, ''Player'', make an offer! How much for your... "Drool With Joy" recipe?}}

*''2000 Gols.''
*''200 Gols.''
*''50 Gols.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=200 Gols.
|You drive a hard bargain, but, um. Well, I think I'd better taste it first, although, I might be able to guess all the ingredients, maybe that's not fair... But 200 Gols for a noodle dish?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|I should take some time to think this over...}}

:*''Mabel thought 200 was fine...''
:*''Please! You're my only hope!''
:*''Actually, I'm just gonna go.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=Mabel thought 200 was fine...
|She did, huh? Hm, Mabel... she's a fine enough lady but, eh, I can't really stand the idea of being out-noodled by anybody, no matter how much I like 'em.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|Tell you what! Since everyone's after this recipe, how about I pay you double! But only if you promise to keep the "Drool With Joy" noodles a Blue Moon exclusive in Sandrock, deal?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|Well, pleasure doin' business with you, ''Player''. It seems the student has become the master! And in such a short time, too... Hm, if you get time, could you maybe share some pointers with Grace?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|In any case, I'll try out your recipe soon and let you know what I think. Thanks a lot!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=Please! You're my only hope!
|Ahhh, what can I say? I've gotta try these noodles! 200 Gols, you got it!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|Well, pleasure doin' business with you, ''Player''. It seems the student has become the master! And in such a short time, too... Hm, if you get time, could you maybe share some pointers with Grace?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|In any case, I'll try out your recipe soon and let you know what I think. Thanks a lot!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=Actually, I'm just gonna go.
|Oh? Well, alright. Sorry if all my deliberatin' put you off. If you change your mind, come back and we can probably work something out. If you want, that is.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=50 Gols.
|Huh? You kiddin' me? Fifty, that's all?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|C'mon, ''Player''. I won't do you like that. Your recipe's got to be worth more than fifty Gols. Here, let me put another one-fifty on top. You deserve at least as much!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Well, pleasure doin' business with you, ''Player''. It seems the student has become the master! And in such a short time, too... Hm, if you get time, could you maybe share some pointers with Grace?}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Oof. Er...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Two thousand? That's a bit steep, don't you think? I mean, what if I can't sell any of these "Drool With Joy" noodles? That puts me in a pretty bad spot, y'know! Could you go any lower?}}
