{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Mmm! The savory broth... I can feel it in my joints! Is that Yakmel I taste? Excellent choice! Oh, and the noodles are so fresh! And the veggies really balance out the spice... Even my wife would love this and she's- Oop. Noodles almost made me spill the beans...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Builder, you've done it! This dish is exquisite! I'm going to take this across the Free Cities. I surmise that the demand will be high.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Gosh, you don't know how many other people I went through trying to get this recipe right... But you, you're the one! The one who can bend noodles to your very will...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|I think I'll call them... "Chaojimalatuoniudelipleasantaciousmian!" That's Seesaian for... makes you "Drool With Joy!" Because they make me drool. I'm gonna trademark that.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|...Eh, anyway! I'm going to start talking to restaurant owners in other cities. Meanwhile, feel free to start selling the recipe around here in Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Maybe you can work something out with that saloon guy, what's his name? Joe? Just don't sell the recipe for anything less than 200 Gols, got me? Okay, we're pals now, so I'm gonna share with you a couple of tricks of the trade...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|First rule of making a deal: you gotta ease into it, {{textcolor|green|don't just strike straight to the heart of the matter}}, ask 'em about their family or something, remember how I did? Second rule: {{textcolor|green|always let 'em know that you've got other options}}! Make 'em desperate!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|That's all, I'll be on my way. I'll send you any profit share later.}}
