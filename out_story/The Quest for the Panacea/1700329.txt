{{dialogue|Trudy|''Player'', you came! Well, let's get today's meeting started.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Greetings, humans.}}

*''A Ahhhhh! A lizard man!''
*''Why did you invite the Geegler President?''
*''Larry, why are you here?''

{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=A Ahhhhh! A lizard man!
|Ahhhh! A human!}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|You jest, strong human. Funny.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Why did you invite the Geegler President?
|I am also uncertain. Ruling human called me here.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Larry, why are you here?
|I am also uncertain. Ruling human called me here.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I asked Larry to come today. It's all because of Professor Luo's findings... I believe Larry may know more about it than we do.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|So, Professor Luo, why don't you start us off with an explanation... I'm sure everything will be a lot clearer after that.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Thank you, Mayor Trudy.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|First I will address the issue of the soil. Nia, Zeke, and I have done hundreds of experiments on local samples since we've been here. We've managed to garner a wealth of information from them.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|As it turns out, the soil quality varied widely depending on the area, much more than our models were predicting. This is the key reason why the planting failed in the Eufaula Outback!}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|For example, these are the samples results from near Gecko Station.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|You can see that for whatever reason, we're postulating maybe the proximity to the oasis, the sand in the area is much softer, and under ideal conditions, the nutrition level is adequate for growth.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Now, on the surface, the sand in the Outback seems to have similar qualities. But upon closer inspection, the sand there has too much saline in it. Creating an incredibly low moisture level in the soil, making it unsuitable for water retention.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Much of the Eufaula used to be part of the ocean floor before weapons used during the Day of Calamity raised it. The salinity left over makes the sand hard and extremely arid. That's why even the algae failed to form a biocrust...}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|That's our report.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Soil quality is everything. I should have figured this out earlier, and instead we wasted so much time and water...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|The differences in the soil were incredibly subtle, Mr. Zeke. We only found this out after hundreds of experiments. You can't blame yourself.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Uh... ruling human, why am I present? I do not understand any of these words.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Ah, about that. After we made the discovery, I asked Zeke about the source of the algae. The way I figure it, the Old World scientists must have been testing different types of algae for their own biocrust efforts, which is well documented.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|We then went with Logan to the Sunken Ship Ruins to recheck all the algae growth there to see if there are any that can reduce the salinity and increase water retention. But we didn't find any, all the algae on that ship were the same type.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Still, the ship must've been going somewhere, maybe a laboratory or something, and Mr. Logan said he remembered such a place.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|That's right, I reckon I'd been some place like that, some kinda Old World lab. In fact there are several of 'em out in the desert.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Once I was chasin' a bunch of Geeglers with my Pa when we stumbled onto this high tech ruins. It was just a short hop from the entrance to the Portia tunnel. What was inside sure did look a lot like the stuff from the Sunken Ship.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|We weren't in there long, me and my Pa both got fierce headaches so we had to turn away. When we went again, the place got sealed off by a rock slide, a sandstorm had done our job for us... Seemed pretty lucky at the time.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I reckon Larry might know a thing or two about it, since his Pa was the leader back then...}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Yes... I know that place well.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|We have many nests, the location you mentioned is our "Headquarters."}}

{{dialogue|Player|(What should I ask?)}}

*''Headquarters?''
*''Why did Logan get a headache?''
*''Are there algae incubators inside?''

{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Headquarters?
|Yes, it's a place we call the Geegler main office. Legend says the first Employee took the Holy Book from there... but ah, that's just what the elders say, no one's sure.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Xena's Grandfather used to be the keeper of that place...}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Why did Logan get a headache?
|I'm not sure...? We never had such an issue...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|You sure you don't got some Old World gadget in there that's emittin' brain rays?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Now that you mention it... there is a machine that's producing a constant ping sound in our HQ. It never bothered us so we let it be...}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|answer=Are there algae incubators inside?
|Algae incubators? What's that?}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|Ah, I have an algae sample right here, have you ever seen this before?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|indent=true|Oh! Oooh! You mean the meal machines! These are delicious! And yes, they have a variety of offerings!}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|That's it!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Fantastic, Larry! But if there's such a machine, how do we disable it? Maybe we need to talk with Director Qi as well?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|No problem, I'll go talk with him!}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Hmm... you know, ruling human, if you don't mind, I can just go disable it. If there are other Geeglers inside, I'll tell them you're friends, so they won't attack you when you enter.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Thanks Larry, but you sure doin' this won't get you... fired?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Even though I know it's a joke, law human, that's still rude!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|S-sorry.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Will you be able to do that for us, Larry? It might be dangerous...}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Worry not, ruling human, I've come to like this town, and I want to do my part in times of need.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|That's very kind of you, thank you. Now we just need an exploration party to go in and pick up the algae samples. Justice?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Mayor, I'll go. With the Civil Corps still lookin' for any Duvos leftovers, we just can't risk sendin' the Sheriff on every unplanned errand. How 'bout me, ''Player'', Larry, and the professor?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|You're soundin' a lot like your Pa right now...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Um... the professor has been overworking too much lately, I'll go instead. I know what to look for, and I've taken defense classes, so I won't slow you down.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Fine by me. What do you say, Trudes?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Sounds like a plan then, but what about the rocks blocking the way?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|...I don't understand, can't we just climb the rock walls? Isn't that easier?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Uh... dunno 'bout you, but we weren't designed that way.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Woah.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I reckon we'll need that drillin' robot to break it down, a normal Pickhammer just ain't gonna cut it. You think you can handle that, ''Player''? You'll need to talk to Qi about it.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Once ''Player'' has the robot, let's meet up at the rock slide. Come prepared, Larry hasn't been there in a while, so who knows what we'll be facin'.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|You got it!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Then it's decided. Thank you everyone for coming today. I hope we get some results soon!}}
