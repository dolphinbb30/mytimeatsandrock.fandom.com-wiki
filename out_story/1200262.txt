{{dialogue|Burgess|Let me give it to you straight, ''Player''. We know you're within your rights to have this AI working for you, it's just... some of us... we're scared.}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|That thing tried to hurt people! Just think what might happen if you forget to feed it its nuts and bolts for the day, ''Player''. It'll kill again!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|And, ''Player'', did you know that over 99% percent of AI in our world are crazy and evil, I mean, you yourself spend plenty of time in the Paradise Lost hazardous ruins. Have you ever met a nice robot in there?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Statistically, it's very unlikely this is one of the "good ones!" I'm really worried about everyone's safety! Especially you, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|Getting back on topic: what's more... un...religious...? Than putting me out of a job! How am I supposed to compete with an AI machine barber!? I'll be out on the streets faster than you can say frosted tips!}}
