Title: Renowned Representative Returns, Rejoice!
After what seems like ages, finally our beloved mayor has rejoined our ranks! 

Mayor Trudy set off into the desert testing new plant samples for Zeke's ongoing research into desert planting. It was dangerous, perhaps some might even say reckless, but whatever you believe, it's hard to argue with results! 

That's right, Trudy has returned safely, what did she find out there in the desert? Find out more at the upcoming Fireside!

When pressed for comment, Mayor Trudy had this to say on the matter: "Oh, Heidi. You don't need to do a news article on me. I'm sure people will just find out on their own if they're interested." Well guess, what? I did it anyway! 

Welcome back, Trudy!

{{dialogue|Trudy|Uhm, Director Qi... why are you here?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Why am I here? Zeke was faced with this very, very provocative problem, and I couldn't let my dear old pal monopolize the merriment, so I-}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Qi ran out of food, so he came over to the farm while I was unloading the parts. After that... well, he's still here.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Now, now, you say potato, I say Solanum tuberosum. No reason to dwell on the useless details. Point is, we've solved your problem, Mayor. Maybe.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|M-my problem?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|We?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes! Desertification isn't exactly a problem unique to Sandrock. They had the same problem back in the Old World, where overpopulation and climate change destroyed much of the biocrust! They overcame it by regenerating the biocrust at an abbreviated rate!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|He's talking about the top soil. Normally it takes decades or more for the top soil to reform under even the most ideal conditions.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|That's why all of our soil experiments have failed so far, Trudy. Our soil couldn't stablize fast enough before being blown away by the wind.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|And that's where science comes in. This machine you guys found, it's fascinating! I don't know why it was in that ship, but it grows a solution of green algae and cyanobacteria. Zeke triple checked the liquid samples we scraped off the parts.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|You pump some of that nutrient juice on to the sand and it'll grow a new biocrust before you can say "geomorphological!"}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|How can you be so sure? How do you even know that this machine made this algae soup?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I'm impressed you're following. I read about it in Zeke's book. There are pictures, it all matches.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|I knew about this machine as well as the type of method, but I didn't know the formula or the logic, so all I could do was take educated guesses that didn't really work.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|And before anyone thanks us, we have already designed a diagram for this Hydroponic Incubator, that'll function similarly. Maybe.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Trudy, this might be our best shot. Frankly, if this doesn't work, we might as well give up. The desert wins. We've just about tried everything.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Let's do it. We've got nothin' to lose.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Builders, I hereby officially commission you to help us make two Hydroponic Incubators.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|This is exciting!}}

*''I've got this.''
*''Wait, I didn't get the biocrust part.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Wait, I didn't get the biocrust part.
|Ohhh! Let me explain this in detail, I just read about it from the book:}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|The biocrust is a form of protective skin that covers the soil surface in many ecosystems around the world including hot, cold, and arid environments; it's even observed in the Peripheries. It's composition includes an assortment of cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae, lichens, mosses, and...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|Uh, yeah... it means once we have a biocrust, we can plant plants that can eventually return the sand into top soil. We can turn the desert green again!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I'm counting on you two. When you're done with the machine, help us install it here at the Moisture Farm.}}
