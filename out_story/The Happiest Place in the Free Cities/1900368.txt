(cId 0) A conversation 4787_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Catori|Hey ''Player''! I heard from Mayor Trudy that you and the Corps managed to seal the mutant monsters from the Valley of Whispers? You guys are the best!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I've got some good news of my own! First, I've managed to secure a loan from the Free Cities Bank that's able to cover the first few rides and a year of operation.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Second, after hearing my business plan, Mayor Trudy has agreed to lease the land of the Valley of Whispers to Catori World for the next twenty years for ten percent of equity.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|And third, I did some market research with Andy and Jasmine. They took me to Logan's hideout, which had many entertainment relics. I think we could use some of the assets for a setup.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Really wish I could get in touch with that Haru guy who did most of the fixing there but... what are ya gonna do.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I added their feedback to what I had already planned before. I think for the first phase of the complex, we'll be making Coaster World, Toy World, and Racing World. What do you think?}}

*''This is gonna be great!''
*''I like your new attitude!''
*''People will come for this?''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=This is gonna be great!
|I know right?! I think people will be amazed by the experience! As much as we despise some of the practices from the Age of Corruption, I don't think having fun is one of them!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|If people want to come to the park, Sandrock will become a hot, hot place!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I like your new attitude!
|reward={{NPC2|Catori|rp=3}}|I don't know if we can pull it off, but getting Andy, Jasmine, and my son on my side really got me excited!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|The thought of those kids enjoying what I'll build for them, just makes my heart sing.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=People will come for this?
|reward={{NPC2|Catori|rp=2}}|Oh yeah, I'm ninety percent sure of it!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I think people will be amazed by the experience! As much as we despise some of the practices from the Age of Corruption, I don't think having fun is one of them!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|If people want to come to the park, Sandrock will become a hot, hot place!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Anyway, ''Player'', I must enlist your help again. I'll pay you this time, of course, unless you want equity? Mi-an and Commissioner Wei already opted for shares. What do you think?}}

*''I want shares!''
*''I want money!''
*{{flirt}}''I'm doing this for you!''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I want shares!
|You got it. I'll also give you ten percent in shares, same as City Hall, because you've been such a big help throughout my time here. I don't think I would be where I am if not for you!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I'll tell you more details in a letter.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I want money!
|Of course! I'm well prepared this time to compensate your hard work. In fact, I'll still throw in five percent in shares, because you've been such a big help throughout my time here. I don't think I would be where I am if not for you!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I'll tell you more details in a letter.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=I'm doing this for you!
|Aww, that's so sweet of you! I'm so happy you feel that way, but work is work, and I won't take no for an answer!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|Anyway, ''Player'', I must enlist your help again. I'll pay you this time, of course, unless you want equity? Mi-an and Commissioner Wei already opted for shares. What do you think?}}

:*''I want shares!''
:*''I want money!''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=double|answer=I want shares!
|You got it. I'll also give you ten percent in shares, same as City Hall, because you've been such a big help throughout my time here. I don't think I would be where I am if not for you!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=double|I'll tell you more details in a letter.}}

|Of course! I'm well prepared this time to compensate your hard work. In fact, I'll still throw in five percent in shares, because you've been such a big help throughout my time here. I don't think I would be where I am if not for you!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=double|I'll tell you more details in a letter.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Ok, glad that's settled! Now then, since we've worked together the most, I really want you working on the most important aspects! And... there are a lot of parts. What do ya know, turns out amusement parks are hard to build, haha!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|For Coaster World, Heidi has already helped me design the Coaster Support and Coaster Tracks. Here are the diagrams for these. Mi-an and the Commissioner will also be helping with these and the staging area.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I'm leaving the Coaster Carts up to you. I think we'll need Director Qi's help for that.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Now, for Racing World, Mi-an and the Commissioner will build the race course, I need you to make me some Sand Buggies. Again, for these, I think you'll also need Director Qi's help.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Finally, for Toy World, Mi-an and the Commissioner will help me gather some old toy blocks and figures from Logan's old hideout. I need you to make some Bumpers. Fun little things that can launch you into the sky!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Andy's already given me the Worktable recipe for that, here you are.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|reward={{i2|Catori World construction Plan|1}}|I'm know that's probably a lot to take in, so I have a copy of my plan for you. Take a look when you're confused on the direction.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|When you're done with them, please install them in the Valley of Whispers at the designated locations. Catori World won't open until all of them are in place!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Beyond that, I'll also be placing some commissions for things like the gates, the sign, lights, fireworks and food. So grab these if you're up for it.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Anyway, thanks for help ''Player''! This will be epic! My son said he'll be here for the opening ceremony! I'm so pumped! Mama's gonna make him proud!}}
