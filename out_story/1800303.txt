{{dialogue|Zeke|I've read about it, it's very different from what we have here, since you guys don't get much sunshine. But due to the climate, I'd assume all the crops have very low yields.}}

{{dialogue|83032|Ooh! That's a good goal. If she succeeds, we won't have to fight wars anymore...}}
{{dialogue|83033|Yeah, good point!}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Why... doesn't the Empire just trade with the Free Cities for food?}}
