{{dialogue|Pen|Barkeep! Fix me up with only the heartiest of meals! A warrior requires sustenance!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Hm. Well, we have Hot and Sour Fish, that's kinda high protein. But it might be too spicy for you.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Hah! I laugh in the face of such a meager challenge! Too spicy for Pen? Hah! I laugh again!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|If you're into spicy stuff, we actually just got some Duvos Peppers in. I've been wanting to make a Lucien Crepe, but no one's been brave enough to try it yet. Can I fix you one?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|The known world, yes.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|The ones known for... causing anyone who consumes one to immediately dunk their heads in the nearest water source as some feeble attempt to alleviate the pain...?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|One and the same.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|...Hm, I don't know, I mean... we've all got a big day tomorrow... Such a spicy pepper could be not so good for my stomach, you know?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Aw, don't tell me the big, brave Protector of Sandrock is afraid of a widdle chili pepper...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|It's just-}}
