{{dialogue|Qi|Ah. There you are. I have recently upgraded the telescope. I have increased the aperture, allowing for an observational field 27% higher than previously achievable. In fact, the locals have been using it too.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The satellite that I've been tracking, "Scavenger" will be passing above Sandrock around {{textcolor|green|21:00PM tomorrow}}. I thought, perhaps, you would come and observe it with me.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''See you then!''
*{{flirt}}''Is this a date?''
*''I've got a lot on my plate...''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=See you then!
|Remember the time. Please, do not be late. Scavenger is not a synchronous satellite, it will not remain stationary. Current science has not confirmed the existence of remaining synchronous satellites.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I've got a lot on my plate...
|Of course. I simply believe with two people, observation will be more efficient. Perhaps if you reconsider, you can meet me regardless.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|This is important observational analysis, not a date.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|We will be able to gather much more information together.}}
