Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|We have to win this fight, ''Player''. We just... have to. We're no better off than the Age of Corruption if we're still using force to solve real world problems.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|Oh, those Duvos nobodies... just lemme at 'em! I'll murdalize 'em! I'll turn 'em in to mincemeat! I'll... Well, maybe I'll just take a page out of Haru's book and throw stuff at 'em from a distance... Never can be too safe when it comes to battlin'.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Okay, so Duvos is coming. We're still pitching plans, right? Here's mine: We bury Sandrock. Yeah! We bury the whole town in sand, leave, and then come back when they're gone! I call it, "Operation: Sandberry!" Eh? Eh? Come on, everyone needs a little humor right now.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|The Duvosians are coming! The Duvosians are coming! One bucket of water if by land, two if by sea! Oh. Yeah. We're in the center of the continent. Well, you get the idea! W-w-water you waiting for!?}}

{{dialogue|Catori|You bet your sweet can, I'm stickin' around! This land is your land, this land is my land! From the Water Tower to the modest band stand! I'm headed over to the Civil Corps to get strapped!}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Good! Let Duvos come! Nothin' like a good war to put hair on your chest! Don't worry, I'll be backin' you up on that there shooter thingie, ''Player''! I'll go polish ol' Betsy with a lil extra butter... an' worcestershire sauce!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Ri-ri had a fire in his eyes I've never seen before... I'll bet he's arriving in Highwind as we speak!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Duvos is coming! This means war! Let me see your war face, ''Player''! ...Nah, that, don't scare me. Work on it. This is a war face: "Ruaaaaah!"}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Hm... being killed in battle would be really bad for my writing career. Then again, it might really hone my writing skills... but I'm scared...}}

{{dialogue|Fang|I will be ready... if someone gets hurt.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|''Player''... The fight to come won't be easy. But knowing you're on our side makes me believe we have a chance. If you've got any... secret tools or anything you think you can make at your workshop... now might be a good time.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|I wish we had time to prepare more defenses... Just think, we could've put Qi's turret technology all over a wall around the city! Ah, well. Next war.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Hey, before all this goes down with Duvos, don't be a stranger at my shop. The right tool for the job can mean the difference between life or death... and not just for yourself...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Duvos... they're even worse than it said in my history book. This is what happens to people if they never get any sun, I guess...}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Duvos has troops along the railways, ready to ambush us... I'm thinkin' I might drive one into 'em anyway, ''Player''! Like a train bat out of heck!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|This is what it all comes down to, ''Player''... This is gonna be the fight of our lives. No amount of training'll change what happens then. It'll be a test of pure grit. And you've got that in spades.}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|The Duvos army, they don't know we're ready for 'em, do they? Well, we got one thing goin' for us, then. We've got you, ''Player''. Let us know if we can help in any way.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Duvos attacking Sandrock... I never thought something like this could happen. I'm afraid but... I have faith in our Civil Corps, and I have faith in you, too, ''Player''. Even after all this, the Light is still on our side!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|How did it come to this... sigh.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Whew. Would you have signed your contract if you'd known it'd come to this? I'd like to be all gung-ho and say I would but... I totally wouldn't. Well. No backing out now! Let's give it our all!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Mm... yes... I've heard the news. Truly splendid, isn't it? Duvos is on their way here to rescue its collaborators no doubt! Don't you see? This is why I support them, no one gets left behind there!}}

{{dialogue|Mort|They attack because they are coerced by a despot. We defend because we are compelled by our bond to this place and each other. I am not afraid.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|When I hung up my adventurin' boots, I thought my fighting days were over... Looks like we're gonna have to have one last crusade for ol' Sandrock... Good luck, ''Player''. I've got your back.}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Hate those Duvos uniforms. They really put the "fash" in fashion if you know what I mean... Oh, and good luck with our defense! We're all rooting for you.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Oops! Did I forget to mention Duvos was about to attack the town? Must've slipped my mind, hahahaha!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Don't worry, ''Player''. I've already calculated the odds of our survival. I'd best not share them with you, as hearing the odds may lull you into a false sense of security and affect your performance on the turret. But let me put it to you this way: I have not fled town yet.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|I'll have me an' the boys keep the mines clear, we can fall back there if it comes down to it, but... Don't worry. I'm gonna be right up there on the front lines with ya.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|''Player''... have you spoken with the other folks in town? Everyone's... staying! I... I must say it is humbling that everyone feels the way I do about our home but... This means everyone's relying on us, too...! Let's win this fight!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|If Duvos wants our rocks, they're gonna have to take 'em from my cold, dead hands.}}

{{dialogue|Venti|Rocky came and talked to all of us, he said no matter what happens, we're all family to him. Peck cried, but you know me, a tough upbringing made me able to get through anything! Don't worry, Venti will find her way!}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Those Duvos boys, what they really need is discipline! Oh... you say... they have every aspect of their lives controlled by an emperor? Well... less discipline, then!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Listen, newbie. I can help in the fight against Duvos. I have a secret plan to totally destroy them! It's so secret... I don't even know what it is yet! C'mon... lemme ouuuuut!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Duvos, huh? Well. Better get my throwin' arm into shape...}}
