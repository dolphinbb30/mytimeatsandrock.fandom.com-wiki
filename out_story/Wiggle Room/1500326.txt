{{dialogue|Nia|I think the worms could be a key element in normalizing the environment around here once the trees are in place. I mean, we can't always go around watering the place with algae juice, it needs to be self sustainable.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Along with the worms, Zeke thinks that we should be introducing more plant species into the desert. So that's what we've been working on.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|If everything goes smoothly, we'll be able to increase the plant variety around Sandrock tenfold! It's so exciting!}}

{{dialogue|Nia|I've had this idea at work recently, and I just need a teeny weeny, little, really really tiny little favor...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|I've been studying soil nutrients with Zeke, and I want to cultivate a terrarium, a kind of ranch, for... Sandworms. It's a really common method used for improving soil nutrient structure, I studied it pretty extensively at school.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Design wise it'd just be a pretty simple, but sturdy, box that can hold the worms and soil. Oh, it'd need some sort of heating to keep a constant temperature, that way it can be consistent.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|So, what do you think? Could you build me a Sandworm Terrarium?}}

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|When you've built it, we need to put in some paper, water, and soil. Oh! And some food for the little guys of course! Then we can put in some Sandworms and we're good to go!}}
