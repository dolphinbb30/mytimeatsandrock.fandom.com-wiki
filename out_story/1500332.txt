{{dialogue|Catori|Hey, ''Player''! You got a moment? Wouldn't mind a quick chat.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|You remember the development proposal dinner Trudy did a while back? She asked me again recently if I had any new ideas since things are looking up. You know me, I'm always full of ideas, but...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Uhh... Look, we got the Game Center and Museum upgraded, and they're doing really well. The Sandrunning's doing decent, as well. All thanks to you guys' investment and help!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|And I mean, I'm honored that the Mayor now sees me as an integral part of Sandrock's development, but...}}

*''What is it?''
*''Hey, what happened to your can-do attitude?''
*''It's about your son, huh?''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Hey, what happened to your can-do attitude?
|I think I'm just at a point where I'm looking at the opportunity cost and thinking maybe this is enough for me? What I have in mind for what comes next is a giant leap that I'm unsure that I should take...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=It's about your son, huh?
|Yeah...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|You know, I never told you this before, but I tried to open a small business in Atara before. My then husband didn't like it one bit. "A man should provide for the family!" He said. Even though he was terrible at it and wasted it all on leisure...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|So I divorced him. Then came out here looking to prove him wrong...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I might have been a bit-... no, totally naive when it came to my expectations versus reality. That "I'll show him" attitude only lasted until the first time I had to pay interest on the loan. The time here in Sandrock really took a lot out of me...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|My son Alo... he's a teenager now! I thought I would take some handouts from Sandrock and make a profitable business out of it, and then give him the perfect life! But the reality is, my career is keeping me away from him!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I always had this dream, this idea of a beautiful entertainment complex I call Catori World! But now that I've had actual entrepeneural experience, I know how hard that'll be.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|And now it's a wrestling contest between my dream and my baby... it's hard...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Sorry, I'm rambling... I'm proud of how far I've gotten. But you get what I'm saying, right?}}

*''Oh yeah, I totally get you!''
*''Just talk to your family...''
*''Maybe you should quit while you're ahead?''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Oh yeah, I totally get you!
|Yeah, you must've encountered a bunch of obstacles on your path to become a great Builder. Ahh... we're kindred spirits on the same boat.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Just talk to your family...
|I really should. I've been trying to be the one that does it all, but that's just like what my husband did...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Maybe you should quit while you're ahead?
|Maybe... since all my operations are at least profitable now, if I sell them, I should have enough to get my son through university...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Anyway, I think I need to figure this one out between myself and my family. But I really needed to get that off my chest.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Thanks for hearing me out, ''Player''.}}
