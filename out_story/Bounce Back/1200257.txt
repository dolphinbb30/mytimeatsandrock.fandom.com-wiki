{{dialogue|Justice|Hey there, ''Player''! Come by to admire your handiwork? Heh, yeah, we got that robot good.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I reckon we'll leave it there for a little while, have the city work something out with Vega 5, ship it off for study. In the meantime, I went ahead and put it in the cell. Don't want it to wake up, go crazy, turn into another dancing robot fiasco...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Wait a sec... ''Player''... Don't tell me... You're not thinking of repairing this thing, are you?}}

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Listen, ''Player'', I know that robot thinks you're attractive or whatever, but don't be lured into its flattering trap! This thing tried to kill us!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Howdy partners! Come to see the dead robot, ''Player''? I was actually hoping to talk to you two, today must be my lucky day!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Guess you did probably save... fifteen minutes or so of walking between where we live, but, uh, listen, whatever it is, if it's about the robot-}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I've found a diagram for a {{textcolor|green|Power Cell}} that will get this AI functional again!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|What the...!? Seriously? I was literally just telling ''Player'' here how we should absolutely not do that!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Come on, Justice. Think of what we could learn from this thing!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|We're going to send it to Vega 5! Let them learn about it!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Or... let Sandrock have some scientific discoveries for once! Trust me, I've read plenty about AI. It can't harm anyone unless directed by a malicious user, or... if it's gone completely insane, or maybe sentient. But we'll turn it on together! It'll be fine.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Sigh... Well, look... This is all far above my pay grade anyhow. Only person who can make this call is the Mayor...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Trudy already said it's fine.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Huh?! Why didn't you lead with that...?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Trudy trusted in me to get this done. I wanted you to trust me too, Justice!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Well, ain't that sweet. Ah, heck. 'Course I trust you...}}

|Whaaaaat? Really? After my big compelling speech? Oookay, ''Player''... I can't make you do anything you don't want to. I'm just gonna give you this here diagram, aaaand... eh, you know. If the {{textcolor|green|Power Cell}} gets made, it gets made, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Well, I guess it all started with a little conversation that started between Qi, Grace, and myself. Grace wants to keep this thing in Sandrock to help make a name for herself, and Sandrock in the process!  Could be great for the town!}}
