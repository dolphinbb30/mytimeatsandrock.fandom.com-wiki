{{dialogue|Qi|Ah, you're here. You are practiced in physical activities, correct? Running, climbing, digging. You know, Builder things. I wish to improve my operational efficacy with the Mobile Suit.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|However, physical coordination has always been my weak spot... PE was an elective in the Vega 5 school system, so I opted for physics instead.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Anyway. Do you have any suggestion for me? How does one "work out?" I understand the repetitive repetition of action, but I'm at a loss regarding optimal efficiency activities.}}

*''Dancing is great fun!''
*''A morning jog helps your mind.''
*''Fight! Then you'll look like a beefcake.''
*''Nothing.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Dancing is great fun!
|Hmm... it sounds interesting. A common sport for all ages, and the non-competitive nature allows for easily controlled experiments and study...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=A morning jog helps your mind.
|Hm... running seems to be a popular choice, but in Sandrock the air quality would prove somewhat counter-productive.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I have done research and found that dancing has been found as being one of the most productive forms of exercise, in results to time ratio. Are you familiar with it?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Fight! Then you'll look like a beefcake.
|Fighting would be ill-advised. The longevity of those that engage in such activities is considerably shortened. Besides, potential injury to my head would be devastating for the progression of science.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I have done research and found that dancing has been found as being one of the most productive forms of exercise, in results to time ratio. Are you familiar with it?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Nothing.
|Nothing, interesting. Perhaps you would be suitable for a control group.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I have done research and found that dancing has been found as being one of the most productive forms of exercise, in results to time ratio. Are you familiar with it?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|It seems dancing has a strong positive influence on the physical coordination... and physical coordination is one of the preconditions for operating the Mobile Suit...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Now that I think about it, Vivi dances regularly... does that mean Vivi can pilot the mobile suit?!}}

*''Dancing takes real skill, you know!''
*''You've never danced before, right?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Dancing takes real skill, you know!
|Please don't misunderstand me, I'm just trying to understand the causal relationship between dancing and piloting.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=You've never danced before, right?
|...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|You're arriving at conclusions with scant evidence.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|But no. I have not danced before.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Perhaps you can show me how to dance? If you can prove it's efficacy, I would much appreciate it.}}

*''No problem!'' (No unique dialogue)
*''That sounds like a lot of work...''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=That sounds like a lot of work...
|Understood. I will look for another option.}}
