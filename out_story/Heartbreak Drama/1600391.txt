{{dialogue|Jane|''Player'', did you know Walnut Groove's going to host the "Miss Jane" stage show in a couple of days? It's a celebration of the show's premiere with the original cast reunited for the first time in five years! Tickets were going for ten times the original on the resell market!}}

{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=Is there any other way to go?
|reward={{NPC2|Jane|rp=5}}|I thought about it! I could take a bus to Portia then go by boat, but that takes forever... Or I could take a train to Atara then take an airship, but that costs way too much! It's too late now, anyway...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|Sigh, there's a reason why I loved this show...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=It's just a show, don't take it to heart.

{{dialogue|Jane|The heroine has the same name as mine, Jane. And we're both emigrants with similar backgrounds...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|''Player'', I don't think I've ever told you this. My family was originally from Ethea, we were poor there and moved to Atara when I was very little for better opportunities.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|My Papa was an actor, so he got a job with the Atara University theater. Since I didn't have a lot of friends, and I got free tickets, I went to pretty much every play... That's how I became obsessed with acting.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Later, I moved to Walnut Groove to pursue a career. It was much harder than I expected. I participated in countless auditions but I never got selected for any big roles. I was always that tree in the background... I was just never good enough...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I watched "Miss Jane" at my lowest point in life. Her story taught me I shouldn't wallow in self pity and instead should figure out a way to "keep moving forward."}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I thought back to my time with my Pa in the university theater, there were a lot of teachers there, and they were all so nice. And through their productions, I learned a lot about the world. That's how I found my new calling.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I thought, if I could bring the same joy and wonder to other kids like the teachers at the university theater did, then my investment in my passion would be worthwhile!}}

*{{flirt}}''Jane, I'm impressed by your spirit!''

{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=You must've been through a lot...
|Well, that's life, right? Not everything will go perfectly. You just have to "pick yourself up, dust it off, and keep moving!"}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=Jane, I'm impressed by your spirit!
|reward={{NPC2|Jane|rp=5}}|Thanks, I believe anyone with a determined mind will have that same burning spirit. Same goes for you!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Sigh, I'm just really disappointed to have to miss the show. And more importantly, seeing Ms. Lola in person. I've always wanted to let her know that the Miss Jane she played inspired me and made me determined to become a teacher.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Although I know every word of the play backwards and forwards, Ms. Lola is the real Miss Jane herself!}}

*''How about you put on a show now, I'd love to see it!''
*''No worries, you'll get more chances.''

{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=How about you put on a show now, I'd love to see it!
|reward={{NPC2|Jane|rp=5}}|Oh really? You want to see me as Miss Jane? ...Alright I'll give it a shot!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|answer=No worries, you'll get more chances.
|reward={{NPC2|Jane|rp=2}}|Do you know the story of "Miss Jane," ''Player''? How about I show it to you!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Let me try this part first, to get into the character...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|"I have been rejected again and again, but I'll keep on trying! Do you know why? Because if I give up now, all the people that didn't believe in me, that laughed at me, that hoped that I would fail... They would have been right!"}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Haha, that was fun!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Now let's play my favorite bit where Jane opened up her heart to Mr. Lau and Lau started to confess his love! How wonderful is that!}}
