{{dialogue|Grace|Hey, babe. Things have been going really well over at my drink stand. Lotta customers. Nevertheless, I'm still thinking of ways to improve!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Something I always liked about some of my old spots in Atara is a lot of the "cool" places have their own secret menu. Something only the regulars know about. I could even start naming drinks after some of my favorites who come through...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|What do you think? Sound enticing at all? Who... or what should I put on the menu?}}

*''How will people know to order the secret items?''
*''Why bother with a secret menu?''
*''Name a drink after me!''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=How will people know to order the secret items?
|They don't have to know it. For example, if a regular says, "Today's a good day!" then I'll prepare a "Beautiful Weekend" for them. If they say "I'm flunking school!" I'll make them the "Just Defended My Post-graduate Thesis Smoothie!"}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Official names still pending. As for learning the codes... I'll encrypt them into the old menu. Or maybe... I dunno. If you know, youknow. Y'know?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Why bother with a secret menu?
|Well. I think it's cool. Isn't that enough? But also... it'll be a nice way to give back to some of my regulars and the people who have inspired me in this town...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Name a drink after me!
|Well. You know. Of course that's crossed my mind...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|I'm just afraid I don't have anything good enough to share your name. I'd save that for my greatest masterpiece! Better work on some less complicated flavor profiles first...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|In the meantime; can't make any new drinks without raw ingredients. I've got a bit going on at the saloon, would you might picking up a few things for me if you're going to be out and about?}}

*''Sure, no problem.''
*''Sorry, too much on my plate now.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Sure, no problem.
|Thanks! Here's a list... and... take your time! Be careful out there, too. Love you!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Sorry, too much on my plate now.
|That's alright. Let me know if you get time. I'm still working on those recipes anyways, so there's no rush.}}
