{{dialogue|Grace|Hey, babe. Things have been going really well over at my drink stand. Lotta customers. Nevertheless, I'm still thinking of ways to improve!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Something I always liked about some of my old spots in Atara is a lot of the "cool" places have their own secret menu. Something only the regulars know about. I could even start naming drinks after some of my favorites who come through...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|What do you think? Sound enticing at all? Who... or what should I put on the menu?}}

*''How will people know to order the secret items?''
*''Why bother with a secret menu?''
*''Name a drink after me!''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=How will people know to order the secret items?
|They don't have to know it. For example, if a regular says, "Today's a good day!" then I'll prepare a "Beautiful Weekend" for them. If they say "I'm flunking school!" I'll make them the "Just Defended My Post-graduate Thesis Smoothie!"}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Official names still pending. As for learning the codes... I'll encrypt them into the old menu. Or maybe... I dunno. If you know, youknow. Y'know?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Why bother with a secret menu?
|Well. I think it's cool. Isn't that enough? But also... it'll be a nice way to give back to some of my regulars and the people who have inspired me in this town...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Name a drink after me!
|Well. You know. Of course that's crossed my mind...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|I'm just afraid I don't have anything good enough to share your name. I'd save that for my greatest masterpiece! Better work on some less complicated flavor profiles first...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|In the meantime; can't make any new drinks without raw ingredients. I've got a bit going on at the saloon, would you might picking up a few things for me if you're going to be out and about?}}

*''Sure, no problem.''
*''Sorry, too much on my plate now.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Sure, no problem.
|Thanks! Here's a list... and... take your time! Be careful out there, too. Love you!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Sorry, too much on my plate now.
|That's alright. Let me know if you get time. I'm still working on those recipes anyways, so there's no rush.}}

*''Nice! Happy for your success!''
*''Is "Shadowy Figure" made just for that... "customer?"''
*''Who was that...?''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Nice! Happy for your success!
|Yeah, without you pushing me forward, I think I'd still be chewing on Owen's cookbook at best.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Oh, hey... about what you just saw... There's... something you should know.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Is "Shadowy Figure" made just for that... "customer?"
|Yeah, it's like I said; I wanted to start making drinks for my regulars-}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Wait, were you being jealous?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Who was that...?
|Right. Yeah he does come off as pretty suspicious at times. Good eye. Allow me to explain...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|That guy was a pal from my old life. And... I've been keeping tabs on things here in Sandrock for him, even after leaving the ACI...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I know! I know... just... let me finish...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|He taught me the ropes when I was still green. We had a crew back then, til one of us sold out the rest: Lucky Lucy.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|She was my friend. A friend to all of us. But being in the field long enough... some people'll do anything to get out...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|She led us into a Duvos ambush. Not all of us walked away from that one. But those that did... tracked her down.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|The agents who found her weren't interested in hearing her side of the story...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Some say she made it. But if she did, I'm sure she's made herself into a shadowy figure... a ghost. Living or dead.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|That man you saw has been coming in for a while. I thought it might be nice to spark that memory with the only other person who shares it...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|So... yeah. When the guy who took a bullet for me during that ambush asked if I'd keep an ear to the ground for him out here in Sandrock, well... I could hardly refuse...}}

*''Could this be dangerous...?''
*''So this shop is just a front? How long has this been going on?''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Could this be dangerous...?
|Trust me. I've set my boundaries. No more tasks, no more missions. I stay here in Sandrock. I'm an avid member of the audience at best.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=So this shop is just a front? How long has this been going on?
|No! No... this is real, ''Player''. All of this is real. This is the life I wanted, and this is the passion I choose to pursue.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I... should have told you sooner. But... I promise, this is not that big of a deal. Just a small way of "giving back to my community." I can see... how this might trouble you...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Look! Trust me. I'm on the fringes here. I'm eyes and ears; just make a call in if I see something suspicious. Which I haven't! Sandrock is safe now. So... really, there's nothing to worry about.}}

*''Okay, I trust you.''
*''I want you to get out of the ACI...''
*''Whatever. I'm thirsty.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Okay, I trust you.
|Thank you, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I want you to get out of the ACI...
|Babe... I...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Okay. I will.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Next time they make contact, I'll make it clear.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|I can't stop them from visiting, but I promise... No missions, no serving as a contact, no handling sensitive information. Nothing. I'm out.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Whatever. I'm thirsty.
|Haha... Good!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Now... c'mon! Let's stop dwelling on the past and get back to living our future. Here, try one of these drinks! They're losing carbonation by the minute...!}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I order?)}}

*''Sandrock Beauty.''
*''Shadowy Figure.''
*''Intoxicating Dream.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Sandrock Beauty.
|Wonderful! This drink is a bit sour, a bit sweet... with a soda base and a hint of ginger. But the real kicker is the chili juice I garnish on the lip of the glass.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|I made it for anyone that hasn't been in love yet. But they can still enjoy the feisty flavor and stinging kiss... of the Sandrock Beauty...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Shadowy Figure.
|Ah hah. Have to try it for yourself? Well... Just be ready; this one isn't really meant to be refreshing...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Intoxicating Dream.
|Not feeling adventurous today? That's alright. Good ol' Intoxicating Dream it is.}}
