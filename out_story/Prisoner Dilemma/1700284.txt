{{dialogue|Grace|I'm just gonna say it: I've always thought it was weird anyone could ever be into Pen. I mean. Sure, he's in good shape but as soon as he opens his mouth... Barf.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Written with his left hand?

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|You... really picked up on that?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Yes... many operatives are trained to write in various styles with both hands in order to cover their tracks across documents. But those with a careful eye can spot key consistencies, the way he dots his i's for example.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|But that's not the point, look, doesn't the writing here look exactly like the writing on {{textcolor|green|the burnt letters}}?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=You wrote this fan letter?
|I- Y- What!? No!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|You're trying to say I'm one of those girls who says they hate a guy but secretly I have a crush on them or something? Nuh-uh. And I resent the accusation.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Back on task: this handwriting sample proves that Pen is the one who wrote {{textcolor|green|the burned letters}} we found in the church storage.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Yes. No doubt in my mind that Pen wrote these letters. Which could mean... any number of things. But it confirms that Pen was relaying messages to Miguel from the Duvos side even before he was sent here!}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Hm... so Miguel was hoping to recruit others in town? As in... "turn us to the dark side?" Yikes. Well, if this is anything to go on, we're all there with X's except...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Hey! You got special markings and stuff by your name! Looks like they really wanted to recruit you! I'm jealous. I just got a regular mark. Wait, no... there's a minus next to me and Rian. They really put me in Rian-tier...?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Nice to know I have options.
|reward={{NPC2|Grace|rp=3}}|Hah. Well. I'd think about it. Cloudy, wet, and cold this time of year. And any time of year. As in: all the time. Plus their insurance packages are really "meh."}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=You must have really fooled them.
|reward={{NPC2|Grace|rp=3}}|Hm, yeah. Let's go with that.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|I mean, if they knew who I was, they probably wouldn't try to recruit me, but rather... try to kill me. Which never happened. So I've got that going for me.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=They want me more than you!
|Har har. Sure, of course they do! They didn't know you were working for me, and they didn't know I'm working for the Alliance! They... probably would have tried to kill us...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|So, yeah. Can't blame them for not wanting to recruit a middling cook known for starting fires. Which is all they believed me to be. Which totally worked, by the way.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Hm. Not an expert, but none of this stuff is in the actual Church of the Light scripture. So Miguel is making up his own content? That's bold. He really thinks he's got the chops to make changes to world renowned scripture? It reads like fan-fic...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Okay. This is kind of a long-shot: what if this stuff of his is actually working? I mean, some of those church folk are, let's say, "impressionable." What if he's actually gotten through to some people and like... brainwashed them?}}

*''Let's check on Burgess.''
*''I don't think that's possible.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Let's check on Burgess.
|Fine idea. As the most "impressionable" of church-goers, Burgess would be a fine litmus test to see whether or not Miguel's little fan-fic has done any permanent damage.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I don't think that's possible.
|I mean. You never know. Psychological warfare is a thing. Maybe he's even gotten to us! How have your opinions on Duvos Peppers shifted in the last year? I like them more than I used to...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|HQ mentioned Duvos has made major breakthroughs in this department. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I think it's worth following up on. Let's ask Burgess about it. If anyone's been influenced by this stuff, he'd be the first one to show any sign of it.}}
