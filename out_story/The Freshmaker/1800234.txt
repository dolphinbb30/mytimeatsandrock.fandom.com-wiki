{{dialogue|Grace|Hey, ''Player''! Has Owen told you about his new idea? It's even been approved by the Church and all. We're going to make the world a better place!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Ah, let me fill you in, then. Short of it is, some small villages around Sandrock are just scraping by, eating Sand Rice three meals a day. Owen, being the boss he is, decided to step up and ship some hearty meals their way.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Only question was logistics. We pitched it to the Church and they were on board right away! Had a bit of a back and forth, they said they'll help deliver meals if we, er, Owen cooks 'em up...}}

*''That's a great idea!''
*''Deliver some to me, too! Free, right?''
*''We're giving these mooches a hand out?''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=That's a great idea!
|reward={{NPC2|Grace|rp=1}}|Right? I think it's kind of amazing.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Deliver some to me, too! Free, right?
|Eh... well, we're kinda... trying to help those in need here. Er, just stick with me for a bit longer...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=We're giving these mooches a hand out?
|Ah...? Giving food to people who are having a hard time... Not exactly a hand out, ''Player''. Er, just stick with me for a bit longer...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|These small villages are pretty far from Sandrock, and the desert is a relentless climate. Not so fun fact: perishable food starts to spoil after only two hours in the heat...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Plus, if we're going to bring them food, I want it to be fresh! Their lives are hard enough, they don't need soggy, room temperature noodles on top of the... y'know... hardship and everything.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|So! I designed an Insulated Backpack, based on a takeout box relic found by the Civil Corps.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|It's said that in the Old World, people could enjoy fresh food without even needing to leave their house! These takeout boxes, they used an advanced technology to make a compound of aluminium oxide and silica powder.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|This compound is a soft, flexible material that was used for effective insulation. Using this box, food could be kept fresh long enough to ensure a safe and enjoyable delivery.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I tried to get Qi to look into the tech for me, but he said it didn't seem "worth it." Oh please! Space tech isn't the only thing worth studying ya... ya space case!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Ahem...! Best not get too worked up about it. Anyway, after a bit of my own research, I now have a recipe for the Insulated Backpack. Would you mind helping me make it?}}

*''No problem!''
*''I've got a lot on my plate...''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=No problem!
|reward={{i2|Insulated Backpack|1}}|Thank you so much! Alright, come show me when it's ready! I'm kind of curious to see how useful this Old World tech really is.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I've got a lot on my plate...
|Alright. Let me know when you have some time.}}
