{{dialogue|Grace|I don't really know anything about Logan other than what I hear from Sandrockers who have been here a while. He's got some personal vendetta against this town or something? If he keeps this up, he'll attract attention on an Alliance level; whatever he's thinking, I'm pretty sure all paths lead to a dead end...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Logan and his father were monster hunters; they helped keep us safe, so long as we had the pay to keep them around. How does that saying go? "One who fights with monsters must be careful of becoming one themselves." Well. Too little, too late on that one.}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Yes, I suppose this was bound to come up sooner or later. Logan blames the Church for not being able to save his father. We tried everything we could, but... well, sometimes it's just someone's time. I still have hope that one day that boy may see the Light again.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Logan... Why, I watched that boy grow into a man. And what an honest man his father was. What could have caused him to take such a bleak path... and one I fear has no return...?}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Logan? Well, he used to hang around in the Blue Moon from time to time. He was a little ornery but he always paid his tab. His father passed away suddenly and he... changed, I guess. It's all such a shame...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Logan... I mean, when I left, he was still on our side so your guess is as good as mine.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|You know, I think Logan's been avoiding me on purpose! That's no way to treat an old friend! I'll have to teach him the meaning of "justice" once I finally get my hands around that stringy neck of his... Ooh... ooh hoo hoo, boy...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|I'd say it's most likely Logan losing his father triggered some sort of late-onset schizophrenia. Paranoia, delusions of grandeur... It's all rather tragic; we should be helping him. But I'm afraid the administrative staff won't want to see things from such a perspective. Oh well, none of my business.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Dang, that beautiful wooden fence, it was like, my pride and joy and stuff. Kinda breaks my heart seein' it all totally destroyed like that dude. It's gonna take ages to rebuild...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Logan always attacks from where we least expect. Maybe I need to try to think of somewhere I would never be, then be there. That's how I could catch him, I bet.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I used to bake pies for Logan... to take pie from someone and then go and do something like this! It's a level of betrayal I must say I am unfamiliar with.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Hey, you were face to face with Logan! Why didn't you do anything, eh? Throw a Pickhammer or something at him at least, geez! What do I pay you for, honestly?}}

Title: Dervish Detonates Indispensable Dispenser of Di-hydrogen Monoxide
Logan has returned.

After some time of relative inactivity, Logan has attacked Sandrock directly, in a bold and egregious fashion.

The timing of this attack is precise, and yet confusing. Does he aim to break our spirits in light of our recent success with the Shonash Bridge? Or perhaps he intends to cripple our economy by maintaining the image to the public that Sandrock is an unsafe place? It's likely that only the capture of Logan by Sandrock authorities will give us the answers we seek.

When pressed for comment, Sheriff Justice had this to say on the matter: "Yeah, he ain't my friend no more."

Justice went on to say that he is in talks with City Hall to increase efforts towards the capture of Logan and his gang, and no doubt they will find a way to take action soon.
