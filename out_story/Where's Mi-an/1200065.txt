Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|Logan used to come by my shop from time to time; he was always polite. But I guess it goes to show being polite doesn't make you a good person...}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Do you think Logan dolls would sell? I mean, everyone likes a bad boy, right? ...Too soon?}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Logan was always pretty nice to me when he lived here. Well, except that one time where he knocked me out. But... I'm sure he was just having a bad day. That being said, do what you will to me, but once you lay a finger on my Water Tower, it's personal, bub!}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Logan? Well, to be frank, I can't say I much care for someone trying to ruin the town I gave up everything to start a business in. Lock him up and throw away the key, I say.}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Dang bandits! Get a real job! No doubt Logan and his gang are lookin' to extort us; yeah, for a 'small fee,' they'll leave us alone, well to that I say 'phooey!' You'll have to take my hard earned Gols from my cold, dead hands!}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|I'm already sick of all these Logan problems. Even the Light can't save him anymore.}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|All evidence points to Logan's innocence! What evidence you ask? Well, my gut feeling! And I trust my gut!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Did I miss Logan again!? I was still sleeping when the Water Tower was attacked! Argh, I couldn't see them with my own eyes... forget it, my imagination will fill all the lacking details!}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I don't really know anything about Logan other than what I hear from Sandrockers who have been here a while. He's got some personal vendetta against this town or something? If he keeps this up, he'll attract attention on an Alliance level; whatever he's thinking, I'm pretty sure all paths lead to a dead end...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Logan and his father were monster hunters; they helped keep us safe, so long as we had the pay to keep them around. How does that saying go? "One who fights with monsters must be careful of becoming one themselves." Well. Too little, too late on that one.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Tch. That Logan. What ever happened to "like father, like son?" Nah, that ain't it. That ain't it at all...}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|I talked to Logan before he left... He looked so mad! He told me, "Don't worry, everything will be fine." Why... why would he lie like that?}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Darn that Logan! Now that he's got a taste for destruction, I don't doubt he's got his sights set on one of my trains next. You and the Civil Corps... you won't let that happen, will you? Will you?!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|I once offered up Logan the position of deputy here at the Civil Corps; he said he preferred to remain a free agent. I've never really understood the mercenary type. How could somebody fight for a cause they don't even believe in?}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|That Logan had a real bad life, and now he's tryin' to drag everyone else into it too. It's really too bad, our Pebbles won't ever grow up to be someone like him though!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|A lot of us folks were sympathetic towards Logan; you know, he's been through an awful lot. But goin' and doin' somethin' like this? I don't know what to say...}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Yes, I suppose this was bound to come up sooner or later. Logan blames the Church for not being able to save his father. We tried everything we could, but... well, sometimes it's just someone's time. I still have hope that one day that boy may see the Light again.}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Oh man, and we just finished the bridge as well. What is this Logan fellow up to? Why are there people following him? What's in it for them? Something's just not adding up...}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Logan has shown his true colors. He's had plenty of time to cool down and come to a rational conclusion. Instead, he's decided that he means to continue his assault on our way of life; we have no reason to show him any mercy.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|Logan... Why, I watched that boy grow into a man. And what an honest man his father was. What could have caused him to take such a bleak path... and one I fear has no return...?}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Logan? Well, he used to hang around in the Blue Moon from time to time. He was a little ornery but he always paid his tab. His father passed away suddenly and he... changed, I guess. It's all such a shame...}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|Logan... I mean, when I left, he was still on our side so your guess is as good as mine.}}

{{dialogue|Pen|You know, I think Logan's been avoiding me on purpose! That's no way to treat an old friend! I'll have to teach him the meaning of "justice" once I finally get my hands around that stringy neck of his... Ooh... ooh hoo hoo, boy...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|I'd say it's most likely Logan losing his father triggered some sort of late-onset schizophrenia. Paranoia, delusions of grandeur... It's all rather tragic; we should be helping him. But I'm afraid the administrative staff won't want to see things from such a perspective. Oh well, none of my business.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Dang, that beautiful wooden fence, it was like, my pride and joy and stuff. Kinda breaks my heart seein' it all totally destroyed like that dude. It's gonna take ages to rebuild...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|We've got a million other things to worry about here in Sandrock; I don't care about Logan and his sob story. When you mess with Sandrock, you mess with Eufaula Salvage!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Logan always attacks from where we least expect. Maybe I need to try to think of somewhere I would never be, then be there. That's how I could catch him, I bet.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|I used to bake pies for Logan... to take pie from someone and then go and do something like this! It's a level of betrayal I must say I am unfamiliar with.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Hey, you were face to face with Logan! Why didn't you do anything, eh? Throw a Pickhammer or something at him at least, geez! What do I pay you for, honestly?}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|Luckily, I'd the foresight to store some water in the Moisture Farm, so we're not in a dire situation as far as food supply's concerned. Yet.}}

|Yeah... not that night, but he came into the saloon that day with Haru, and they were actin' real strange, buying up a lot of supplies. It was later that I heard that they blew up the Temple in an attempt to get Howlett out and the old man died in the blast.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Frankly, even if Logan did manage to get Howlett out of quarantine, it would have endangered us all with the disease. Real sad story. Other than that, though, I'm afraid I don't know much of anything...}}
