{{dialogue|Trudy|As you're aware, we're planning for the Alliance Summit. I've already gone over the government invitation list. But I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me get a headcount for invitations from people around town?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I feel like if I ask everyone, it's a little too... official. Most folks would be a bit more comfortable if you handled the surveying. Do you mind?}}

*''Sure, I'll handle it.''
*''No problem. I'm the coolest kid in school!''
*''Too much on my plate, sorry.''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Sure, I'll handle it.
|Thank you! And, well, I must admit some ulterior motives... I don't believe anyone can resist your charm!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Um... just run around and ask whoever comes to mind, then check in when you have anything to report!}}
