{{dialogue|Trudy|Hello, ''Player''! You look well today!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I actually came by to ask a favor, heh heh....}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|As you're aware, we're planning for the Alliance Summit. I've already gone over the government invitation list. But I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping me get a headcount for invitations from people around town?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I feel like if I ask everyone, it's a little too... official. Most folks would be a bit more comfortable if you handled the surveying. Do you mind?}}

*''Sure, I'll handle it.''
*''No problem. I'm the coolest kid in school!''
*''Too much on my plate, sorry.''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=Sure, I'll handle it.
|Thank you! And, well, I must admit some ulterior motives... I don't believe anyone can resist your charm!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Um... just run around and ask whoever comes to mind, then check in when you have anything to report!}}

|Ah, the plate. That old thing. Well, let me know if you get time. I'll just handle it myself otherwise.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|I see! Wow. Quite the guest list. Do you think they're all really going to show up...?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I ended up doing a bit of poking around myself... Cooper asked me to find his old jam band he played with in Walnut Groove twenty years ago, but the only clue he gave to contact them was "they're married to the sea now..."}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Jensen asked me to find Dylon, the "father of modern trains," but with the caveat that he'd only appear if we make the party a five train minimum so that's out...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|In any case, glad you had more luck than me! I'll put all these names on the list. Expect your own invite soon as well!}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey there, ''Player''? Oh, who am I inviting to the party...?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Well, I'd be remiss if I didn't send an invite over to Albert and Mint in Portia. They helped us on our way up, we gotta show 'em where we've made it to now! And, who knows, they might have ideas for where to go next...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Staying good with our friends in Portia is a must. They're our close neighbor, and there've got to be tooons of ways we can help each other out now that the road is done.}}

*''Any personal friends to invite?''
*''There was someone you'd mentioned before...''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Any personal friends to invite?
|Personal friends, eh...?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=There was someone you'd mentioned before...
|Oh. You're talking about Master Verna?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Yeah, I'd be lyin' if I said it hadn't crossed my mind... I did want to ask Master Verna to come see what all we've done here.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|But... that'd be kind of petty, wouldn't it? I didn't come back here just to prove something to an old teacher. I came here because I knew it was the right thing to do.}}

*''I support whatever you want to do.''
*''What if Verna learns something from you here?''
*''What if I invite her instead...?''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=I support whatever you want to do.
|Hey. Appreciate you, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Hm...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=What if Verna learns something from you here?
|Well... It ain't like an old micro-pig to learn new tricks. But, certainly our results here speak for themselves...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|More than anything, I have a feeling she'll have critique up and firing within about ten minutes of seeing our stuff...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=What if I invite her instead...?
|Ah, ''Player''... you don't need to do that. Besides, she trashes any letters from names she doesn't know. Even if you are famous now, I doubt she's heard of you!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Aw, to heck with it. Yeah, let's put her on the list! Worst thing she can do is ignore us. Or... well... show up and make a scene. But I can handle that!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Yeah, there are a lot of things that could go right with this; Master does have major connections in Atara. If she has fun out here, well... who knows? Hm, thanks for spitballin' with me, ''Player''. Go ahead and put her on the list!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|Well, sure, Sandrock has been an integral part of my career, if nothing else. I'd love to help make this event better in any way I can. I could invite the folks, but... this really is developing into more of a meet and greet, business-y type event, isn't it?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|There're my friends at Atara Times... and also all the people who are always writing in to ask how Sandrock is doing...! We've got quite a following over there now, in case you didn't know.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|I've got it! I'll ask my sister to come visit and make an appearance. There's very little I can think of that would garner more attention for our event, other than the leaders meeting, than having the world-renowned "Luna" on the guest list.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Maybe I can even convince her to perform...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|It's settled then! I'll telegraph her immediately. Please put her name on the guest list. Thank you, ''Player''!}}

{{dialogue|Nia|Weeell... I'd invite my folks but... they're in Seesai! Like... what?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|I mean, I always said they should travel but... I meant Portia or... here! The moment I leave and they head for Seesai... that's like a thousand leagues the opposite way!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Hey, you should invite your folks, ''Player''! They're kind of like my second pair of parents so you'd be doing everyone a favor.}}

*''Yeah, I really miss them...!''
*''How could I forget...?''
*''I should've invited them earlier!''
*''They're probably busy...''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I really miss them...!
|Well, yeah! When's the last time you saw them? You must be homesicker than... that one wind turbine that blew halfway to Barnarock... you remember when that happened...?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=How could I forget...?
|Hey, don't sweat it. You've been through a lot lately. Nobody would hold it against you.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=I should've invited them earlier!
|Ah, it's a two way street. They should've visited you earlier!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=They're probably busy...
|Whaaaat? Come on, if you don't invite them, I will!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Yeah, tell Trudes your 'rents are goin' on the list! Oh, and tell your Ma to cook those porkchops I like...! I know this isn't a potluck. Who cares?}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah, ''Player''! What a pleasant surprise! Have you come to celebrate with me?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Yes, it was just yesterday that By the Stairs and The Ceramic Gate reached a combined profit of... one hundred thousand Gooools!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Isn't that amazing? I never really thought we'd make it this far... But... with wonderful friends like you, ''Player'', sure enough, here we are!}}

*''Congratulations!''
*''I came about something else, actually...''
*''For you? Hey, it was nothing!''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Congratulations!
|Thank you, thank you!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|I've been wearing this smile ever since we crunched the numbers. I'm even smiling in my sleep! And every moment I'm here at the store as well. Which has been good; customers always appreciate a nice smile coming their way!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I came about something else, actually...
|Oh! Yes, of course. How could you be coming here to celebrate something I hadn't told you about? Well, what's the news?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=For you? Hey, it was nothing!
|Thank you! Call me old fashioned, but I never forget those that help me. Well. Just know that the feeling is mutual. If you ever need anything, and I mean anything, from Amirah or me, really, don't hesitate to ask!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah, that's right... The big summit! Invitations? Wow, I guess I'd gotten so caught up with the business it all just slipped my mind!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Who to invite... Hm... Well I'm afraid I can't really think of anyone. Everyone back home is pretty tied up at the moment.}}

*''Any business partners?''
*''Anyone you'd like to thank?''

{{dialogue|Arvio|Hm... does anyone fit that particular description?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Oh, how could I forget? We should invite Mr. Musa!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I had meant to write him a letter, thank him, tell him how we're doing but... ehm... Well, I guess I kept hearing this little voice in my head like, "You're small cabbages, Arvio! Musa isn't going to want to hear about any cabbages!"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|But... one hundred thousand... that's a pretty big milestone, right? Certainly surpasses cabbage money. He'll want to hear about that, right?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Yes, ''Player'', if you would, please add Musa's name to the guest list! Of course, he might be busy, but... you never know!}}
