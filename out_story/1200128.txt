Title: Amazing Artisan Amirah Acquires Award
Exciting news from Walnut Groove! Recently they held their famous Ceramics Exhibition, this time with a twist. Sandrock's very own resident artisan Amirah snatched the first place award! 
As a Free Cities mainstay, the Ceramics Exhibition showcases all the most talented artists from across the continent. Amirah was invited as her reputation is constantly on the rise! Seems like Sandrock might just be home to the next big thing.
