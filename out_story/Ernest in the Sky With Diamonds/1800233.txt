{{dialogue|Ernest|Thank you. It suddenly occurred to me that I'd written a particularly beautiful sentence on this piece. Haha, I'm sure it seems strange, to rifle through trash finding a single sentence.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|But to a writer, inspiration comes at but a moment's notice. But I couldn't remember what it was I wrote...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Let me see..."Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate..."}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|No... that's awful... no one would remember that. What was I thinking?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|The stars glisten with the light of a thousand lives, a diamond, an oath, a promise...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|This sentence... what do you think?}}

*''You write really well.''
*''I don't get it.''
*{{flirt}}''It's really romantic.''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=I don't get it.
|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=-1}}|You... you don't like it? Ah, sometimes I kind of get wrapped up in writing a metaphor, perhaps its readability suffers...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|I'm just trying to say... that stars are like diamonds, and that diamonds represent true love, I guess... it's uh, haha... just a metaphor.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|Since coming to Sandrock I've... sigh, almost spent all of my savings. As a writer, I don't have much of an income before each release.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|So in order to stay here and write my books, I need an income to supplement my daily expenses. And I... I can't just ask my family for more money.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|So, my wonderous, amazing, kind Builder... I have a request. For the sake of helping those in dire straits, eating nothing but the "specials" at the Blue Moon... could I ask you for a discount next time I need your services?}}

:*''Of course.''
:*''I can't... The Guild won't allow it!''
:*{{flirt}}''Of course, but you'll owe me one!''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=double|answer=Of course.
|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=1}}|Haha, you're too kind. But no, I was joking with you don't worry. I'm not quite at that level yet, thankfully. I'll pay you whatever you need.}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=double|How about this. I don't need a discount, but I'll still repay the debt. Hmm...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=It's really romantic.
|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=3}}|You understand! Diamonds and stars. Had they eyes, they would have witnessed the greatest of romance. Isn't it a lovely thought?}}

:*''Yeah it's nice.'' (No unique dialogue)
:*{{flirt}}''I want to get to know your ideas even better.''
:*{{flirt}}''I wish I was the one you write poems about.''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=double|answer=I want to get to know your ideas even better.
|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=3}}|I feel like you already understand me. I'd like that too. If I was writing for you...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=double|answer=I wish I was the one you write poems about.
|reward={{NPC2|Ernest|rp=3}}|For you...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Heh, you're too kind. When I was a child, I thought stars were like diamonds. I wrote as such, and even the teacher thought my similes were beautiful. My classmates... they didn't understand. They didn't like it at all.}}

*''Maybe they just hadn't seen diamonds.''
*''They just don't understand art.''

{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=Maybe they just hadn't seen diamonds.
|Hm, perhaps. We were young at the time, after all.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|indent=true|answer=They just don't understand art.
|No... I don't think that's the problem. Everyone is an artist, they just need to find their voice. I think perhaps they just hadn't seen diamonds.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|But I've always been in a special situation. My mother is an actor in musical theatre. Due to this, she was always adorned in fine gems and jewelry... so I had seen many of them from a young age.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Since coming to Sandrock I've... sigh, almost spent all of my savings. As a writer, I don't have much of an income before each release.}}
