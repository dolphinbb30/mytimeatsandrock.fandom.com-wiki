*''In the Blue Moon.''
*''Just gonna ask.''
*''Catori World!''

{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|answer=In the Blue Moon.
|I guess. The Blue Moon's nice and all, but...I don't know. It's not very private.}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|You can do better than that, can't you?}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|answer=Just gonna ask.
|You're kidding, right? After all this time, you're just gonna walk up to her and say "Hey, babe, let's get hitched"?}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|You can do better than that, can't you?}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|answer=Catori World!
|That's a great idea! It's a special place for Ma. A proposal there will be extra special!}}
{{dialogue|Alo|Okay, location locked! What's your proposal plan?}}

*''Bend that knee in a sea of flowers!''
*''A surprise attack on the Roller Coaster!''
*''Do you have something in mind?''

{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|answer=Bend that knee in a sea of flowers!
|Not bad, but this is like the normal stuff, right? We need a wow moment here, like Ma says about her business plans...}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|answer=A surprise attack on the Roller Coaster!
|I like it! Ma won't expect that. But it's missing something...}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|answer=Do you have something in mind?
|I have some ideas. First, we need flowers. Ma loves flowers!}}
{{dialogue|Alo|indent=true|But that's not enough. It has to be really special...}}
{{dialogue|Alo|How about proposing on the Roller Coaster? We can put a basket of flowers in the front cart, so when you reach the tippy-top, the basket bursts open, and you're in a showers of flowers...}}
{{dialogue|Alo|That's when you ask the big question!}}
{{dialogue|Alo|You can't take the ring up there, it's not safe. But you can give it to her after the ride! And maybe even get on one knee, hehe.}}
{{dialogue|Alo|Ma would never suspect it. It's a perfect plan!}}
{{dialogue|Alo|As for the timing... Ma loves sunset. She says it's the prettiest time of the day.}}
{{dialogue|Alo|It's settled then! I need three days to get ready, and all you have to do is show up at Catori World {{textcolor|green|in three days at 5:30PM}}! I'll say we want to continue the tour and go on rides together.}}
{{dialogue|Alo|I'll set everything up, but the rest is up to you! Think really hard about what you'll say when you propose... Maybe practice a few times!}}
{{dialogue|Alo|I have a lot to do. First on my list: ask Nia for her freshest, prettiest flowers. Okay, gotta run. See you in three days! Remember to practice!}}
