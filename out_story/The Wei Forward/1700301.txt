{{dialogue|Wei|Just "Wei" will do, Mayor Trudy. And I think a more appropriate title will be "Commissioner." "President" is an unofficial title conceived by my corrupt predecessor...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Greetings, all. For those who haven't met me yet, I'm Wei, as our Mayor here so graciously mentioned.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Now, I don't mean to frighten anyone, but I must warn you: your old boss Yan and I are like night and day. Any funny business, any slackery, any corner cutting you were getting away with before, it's simply not going to fly with me in charge.}}
The conversation ends.
{{dialogue|Wei|Furthermore, I hope you're ready to all start working as hard as you ever have in your life!}}
{{dialogue|173012|Even more work than before...?}}
{{dialogue|173013|How could we possibly pull off more than 24 hour shifts? Time travel!?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|He had you do that as well? I thought I was the only one he was picking on...}}
{{dialogue|173011|While we're weighin' in, I'd also like to point out that we seem to have skipped over our tradition of startin' all guild meetings with the collective kissing of the presidential ring...}}
{{dialogue|Wang Jr|Right... there was that thing as well...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Yikes. That sounds like a lot of labor violations...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|What the-! Goodness! I knew things were bad here, but I didn't know they were this bad! No! No, no... I was thinking standard eight hour shifts with occasional overtime at triple pay, plenty of paid time off...}}
{{dialogue|173012|Overtime pay...?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Indeed... Alright, well. Slight addendum to my previous claim: get ready to start working more fairly than you ever have in your life!}}
{{dialogue|Wang Jr|Hoorah!}}
{{dialogue|173013|I can finally see my children!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Work-life balance... woah, that takes me back!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|It already looks like you are all getting along swimmingly! What a nice change of pace to have someone so committed in charge of the guild. Now, I hate to hurry things along, but perhaps we ought to get down to business. Heidi, if you please...?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Right. I look forward to working with you, Commissioner Wei. Hello everyone! I guess first: quick refresher. Does anyone remember what we were doing on the tunnel before that whole... world war... invasion thing?}}

*''I think I was smashing rocks...?''
*''We were paving the road...?''
*''Didn't we need more Steel Frames...?''
*''We were just about to name the tunnel after me...?''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=I think I was smashing rocks...?
|That was early on, ''Player''! Then we upgraded the Mobile Suit and got to drilling. Now we're ready for the next step!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=We were paving the road...?
|That's actually the next step, ''Player''. That's what we'll be doing after we finish this. Good hustle, though!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Didn't we need more Steel Frames...?
|reward={{NPC2|Heidi|rp=8}}|Yes! Thank you, ''Player'', that's exactly right!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=We were just about to name the tunnel after me...?
|Har har, very funny, ''Player''. I never pictured you as the class clown!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|That'd be funny!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|To those of you who forgot: we left off drilling about a quarter of the way through the mountain. We need Steel Frames to reinforce what we've dug out already before we continue to drill!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So! Commissioner Wei! I seem to have noticed some... discrepancies in reports from the old commissioner... We should already have enough Steel Frames to move forward and yet...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|These... aforementioned frames appear to be... unaccounted for.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Hm... About that...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Yan melted them down and resold them as scrap.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Ah...!?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Yes, in addition to countless other such commissions that we now have no record of, I'm terribly sorry to report that every single Steel Frame that was built while Yan was here has been embezzled in one way or another.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Yan was stealing our work!?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|That's just the tip of the iceberg...}}

*''I never had anything stolen.''
*''We demand compensation!''
*''What's important is he's gone now.''

{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=I never had anything stolen.
|Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that, ''Player''... It's possible he took credit for something you did without you ever knowing.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=We demand compensation!
|Indeed, ''Player''. It will take time, Yan will have to have his case pushed through the judicial system, but I think all damaged parties can expect to be compensated eventually.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=What's important is he's gone now.
|Indeed...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|You all are upset. You should be. You have every right to be.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|But I'm running a different ship here, we all work together in this Guild. Win or lose, we'll face it together.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|I've been through scrapes before, back in the Periphs; heck, I've seen a man fend off thirteen beasts with nothin' but the shoes on his feet and a can of expired beans. Bouncing back from this? It'll be a piece of beancake!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|In this guild, we push everyone up, not bring them down. I firmly believe that if we're working together, there's nothing we can't do.}}
