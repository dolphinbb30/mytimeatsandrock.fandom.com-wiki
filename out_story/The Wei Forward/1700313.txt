{{dialogue|173131|Hello there, ''Player''. We're Alliance Guards, here on behalf of the Commerce Guild. We're just about to take Yan here over to the Ataran correctional facility. His case sparked interest in the criminal psychology department.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|I'm a genius! A criminal mastermind! E equals MC crime!}}
{{dialogue|173131|I think it was something more along the lines of: they wanted the chance to study a textbook narcissistic sociopath.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|You wanna write a book about me? Fine, sure, long as I get royalties! And my face on the cover! Yeah...! Ol' Yan's makin' a comeback...!}}
{{dialogue|173131|Right... Well, ''Player'', before we go, I wanted to just ask you a few questions. Being in the same guild as Yan here for so long, well, you're kind of a key witness in some of his crimes.}}
{{dialogue|173131|We don't need you to appear in court, just a simple, spoken testimony will be enough. I suppose... if someone had something good to say about Yan, he might get a reduced sentence, but... Well, you'd be the first one, let's put it that way...}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Help me out here, newbie! Tell 'em how great I was! Tell 'em how we were always bestest buds, right from the get-go!}}
{{dialogue|173131|How often did you see Commissioner Yan in his workshop?}}

*''Hardly ever.''
*''Sometimes...''
*''He practically lived there!''

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Hardly ever.
|What!? C'mon! Give me a break, newbie! Oh, wait a sec, I get you...! You hardly ever saw me in my workshop, because you were always in your workshop! Heh heh! That's us, two of a kind, eh, newbie?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|P... please nod 'yes...'}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Sometimes...
|Sometimes!? C'mon, newbie, what kind of wishy-washy nonsense is that!? I thought you were gonna be on my side here! We all know I've done my time! Now you wanna make things even worse for me!?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=He practically lived there!
|Yeah! That's my newbie! I mean... do I sound surprised? Of course that's what anyone would say because it's so very much the very real truth!}}
