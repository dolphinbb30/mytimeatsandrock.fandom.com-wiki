{{dialogue|Mi-an|What!? 500,000!?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|That's right. That's: five... zero zero, zero zero zero. 500,000.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|There must be some mistake...!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|No mistake. Yan really did a number on you, Ms. Mi-an. Nearly every commission you did since you got here, Yan took credit for it. But most of the money is from all the unpaid expedite work. And there was a lot of it.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|He never bothered to destroy evidence of your working hours, so it's all there in black and white.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Curiously, ''Player'', Yan embezzled about ten thousand Gols from your first couple of seasons here, but then stopped...}}

*''He respected me.''
*''He was afraid of me.''
*''He was my true friend.''
*''Who knows what he was thinking...''

{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=He respected me.
|Speaking from experience, I can tell you that Yan respects no one but himself. But if ever there were anyone deserving of respect in his eyes, you might have been the one to make the case.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=He was afraid of me.
|That is possible. You've well established that you are formidable on many fronts, ''Player''. Mi-an, you could take after your friend, ''Player'', a bit more in this regard. Villains like Yan are easily scared off when you stand your ground.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|I'll keep that in mind, sir!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=He was my true friend.
|Hm... I'm sorry, ''Player'', but... I don't think Yan has the capacity to have any true friends.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|He might have seen you as useful enough not to cross you, although... he seemed all too eager to give you up once Duvos came along, didn't he...?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=Who knows what he was thinking...
|The mind of a madman is indeed perplexing... sometimes its best not to stare into that abyss.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|That being said, ''Player'', your numbers speak for themselves. And you will no doubt continue to make the fabulous earnings that go along with them.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Now. Why did I do this in front of you all?}}
{{dialogue|173012|To show us how much better these two are than us...?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Listen here, Ms. Red. I do not play favorites, but I do reward hard work. I want to see the rest of you take a page out of their book! I want to see everyone putting up these numbers, or at least getting closer!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|We're all on the same team here, so don't be afraid to ask for help. ''Player'', Mi-an, you two will offer this lot some sage advice if they need it, won't you?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I... well... I could try...!}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Stop by my workshop any time, folks.''
*''I'm pretty busy...''
*''Figure it out yourself, losers!''

{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=Stop by my workshop any time, folks.
|reward={{NPC2|Wei|rp=10}}|Very good! See? Don't be intimidated! You're a teddy bear, aren't you, ''Player''?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=I'm pretty busy...
|Hm... be that as it may, ''Player''. I do hope you can from time to time offer a bit of advice to your coworkers...}}
{{dialogue|Wei|indent=true|answer=Figure it out yourself, losers!
|reward={{NPC2|Wei|rp=-5}}|Hey! We swore an oath, ''Player''! An oath to promote telesis. You'd do well to remember that.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Yes, ''Player'', you and Mi-an are the star players on our team. But we need everyone at their best if we're to make ourselves into a formidable Commerce Guild on the world scale.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Who's with me?}}
{{dialogue|173012|We can do it!}}
{{dialogue|Slack|Let's make a pact, to take it to the max!}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Dismissed! See you at the commission board!}}
The conversation ends.
