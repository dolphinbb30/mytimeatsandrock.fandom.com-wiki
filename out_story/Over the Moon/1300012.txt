*''Water?''
*''The moon sign above the saloon!''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Water?
|Erm... yes... that is true. Water is hard to come by these days... Though I was referring to the giant crescent moon that used to stand atop of my hotel.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=The moon sign above the saloon!
|Bingo! The Sandrock skyline just isn't the same without it!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I'm still busy patching up everything here, so I was hoping you could find it for me and bring it back... or if it's really gone-gone, make a new one for me. But let's not give up on it just yet!}}
The conversation ends.

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Yeah, I can do it.

If the player fails the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Owen|Hi, ''Player'', I ended up getting Mi-an to help out with my sign situation: she made a new one for me. I guess that means the old one is buried out there somewhere... how mysterious! Well, thanks anyway! Be seeing you.}}
