If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|So... this is it? We understand how all the technology works... all that's left is to implement. Amazing. I think the team that made all this happen will be remembered as the "Peach" of Sandrock...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|I woulda given that Gary a beatin' he'd never forget! Ain't no way he'd get away with takin' my wife! I mean... sheesh... is there nothin' against that in that "Holy Book" of theirs?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Still in early stages here, but... I think it's time to start thinking about how all this is going to affect your career. If we lay the groundwork now, by the time Sandrock is green, we can already have T-shirts, lunchboxes, action figures... Just think about it...!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Honestly, at this point, I'm a little annoyed by the whole ordeal. I really assumed water is all it was going to take to make the forests grow, but... I kind of accept that a lot of this is beyond my control so, I'm just gonna leave it to you experts and... go with the flow! Hah... get it?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|So, run that past me again, you saw "hologram" technology in the undersea lab? It's in Paradise Lost, too? Uh huh... I need to look into that for Catori World...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|So wait a tick, if all the crossbred animals 'round these parts all come from a shadowy secret lab; does that mean the majestic Yakmel, too, is a mutant freak of nature? Noooooooo! ...Ah, well. Never bothered me before, why let it start now?}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|So this new algae tech means we can get back to planting soon? Woo! Well, no rush, but... Hurry up!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Hm... so down in that lab, you found out that a lot of the monsters in our world used to be regular animals? That's... terrible... Well. All we can do is try to understand 'em better... But for now, let's get to plantin'!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|So Gary the Geegler took his opportunity with Larry out of the picture to move in on his wife? Or was it all planned? Cliche either way, if you ask me...}}
{{dialogue|Fang|An algae injection... caused gigantism? Hmm...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I'll have to stop in at those sea lab ruins you found. Pretty wild stuff. It's super rare to find a place with so much information about the monsters in our world. I wonder if there might be clues to lead us to more sites like that...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Alright, ''Player''! This looks like the homestretch! Let's just buckle in and hammer out the last of this stuff, then we can make Sandrock into the city of our dreams!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|So Larry comes back, and he's good, then he meets his... cousin? And he's bad? But his ex-wife is good... these Geeglers are confusing.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Oooh, a showdown with a deceitful relative in a dark Old World laboratory... What an exciting story! I could play the leading lady...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|So Larry didn't get along with his cousin? That's sad... Family is everything!}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|A submarine's kind of like an underwater train. The current is the tracks, but it's a lot longer between stations!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Shame your last run-in with the Geeglers was violent again. Thought with Larry on our side, that was the end of that... Here's hopin' things down that avenue are all sorted. And if not... well, remember: I got your back.}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|Things are lookin' real beautiful 'round here. All these trees've given Rocky some sorta calm disposition, though. He hasn't smashed anything in days.}}
{{dialogue|Larry|I apologize for not being of much assistance against my cousin, Gary! I really thought we were "cool!" I will not make the same mistake again, mark my words!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I feel sorry for Larry. I never thought Gary would do him dirty like that... must be hard to have to face down yer cousin like that. Glad he's with us, though.}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|With Zeke and Professor Luo working together, you and the rest of the construction folk... Why, I'd say we've got ourselves a regular Sandrock dream team! No one could've done it alone, but together, we're gonna do the impossible!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I heard Nia handled herself really well in the ruins with you and Logan. Pretty cool! We've really got a great team on our hands!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|So if this works... Sandrock will be green? I'll... pray for all of you, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|When Martle and I were fighting the desert, we were alone. Now everyone is coming together to attempt what we never could.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|I can't help but think back to those notes we found in the lab... That scientist seemed to really care about the animals he was experimenting on... so... why do it? Ah, well. Let's just think about the future, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Yeah, when I heard about what happened to you waaaay back when at the Breach... that second-in-command lizard guy, Gary? He had Mr. Steal-your-girl written all over him...}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|I was super uninvested in this whole lizard thing until I heard the most recent update. So Gary told Larry's wife that Larry was dead... was that true? Did he know? Did she know? Did they... y'know...  ...kiss?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes... just a few more jobs, ''Player'', and there will be nothing left for us to build except for powerful and awesome technology; the things we actually want to build. Patience triumphs all...}}
{{dialogue|Rian|So there's gonna be like... a forest? So we can cut wood after that, right? Ah dude, people are gonna want stuff built...}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|So you got like a... Mini-Drill now? When you get a minute come on down and show me and da boys how it works... But, uh, don't worry about it, take care of all that plantin' stuff first!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Glad everything went well in there, ''Player''. If not according to plan... But... I believe the hard part is over. We just have to trust the science.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I found a Geegle brochure in a lab that predates the one you guys went to. They used to be a company that just sold gas caps and door knobs. I dunno why nobody ever listens to me on this one.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|The super algae made the lizard guy big and super strong? Can you give me some? I'll use it to get big and strong like Rocky! I won't use it for evil... Promise!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|I always worry when you young folk go running off into some dangerous Old World ruin... Thank the Light you all came out okay.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Brave of you to go in there and settle the score with those Geeglers! But let me tell you one thing I learned back in the Periphs... You see two monsters at each other's throats? Let them fight.}}
{{dialogue|Xena|How foolish of us! If we had wanted to live in Sandrock, we needed only ask! How short-sighted our world domination plot really was...!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Nia told me about that environment changing tech you guys found in those ruins. Pretty interesting stuff. We'll have to check that out at some point...}}
