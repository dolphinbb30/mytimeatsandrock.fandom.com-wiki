*''''Player''.''
*''I don't know...''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=''Player''.
|OK. Next question.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I don't know...
|This is surreal, Grace. You just said ''Player'' when you... How could-}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Next, where are you from originally?}}

*''Highwind.''
*''I don't know...''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Highwind.
|Highwind. Nice weather this time of year, yes? Very windy I've heard.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I don't know...
|Highwind, of course! Grace, ''Player''... just didn't know how to respond to such a weird question, right?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|That'll do. Now I know what you look like when you're deciding whether or not to answer truthfully! Next I'll be asking what I really want to know...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|And don't even think about "bending the truth" to help Owen change my mind, got it? I can read you like a book.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Now! Builder! Tell me! How much did it cost to renovate the Blue Moon kitchen!?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Ahem! You know, more than a few glasses of milk, but less than a herd of Yakmel- Grace, it's fine! I wish you'd just forget about all this...}}

*''It was really expensive.''
*''It was cheap.''
*''It was 10 gols.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=It was really expensive.
|...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Good, as I suspected. Next question...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=It was cheap.
|Yep! Just like I said!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Hm... I see. Next.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=It was 10 gols.
|...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Oh, you're serious?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Hah, haha... I mean, after the discounts... and... you know the Commerce Guild owe me some favors, and... sure, it sounds crazy...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|If you two are going to lie, at least try to make it good. Let's continue, shall we?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|The events in question occured two days prior, and on the second day, when I came to work, the kitchen was already as good as new.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Something here doesn't add up, don't tell me you Builders are now dabbling in magic? Explain.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|What's your angle, Grace? The two new Builders in town are both riled up and full of vinegar; you're just used to ol' Mason and his whiney ways. Nothing unusual here, right ''Player''?}}

*''Yep, normal. I could do it, too!''
*''Mi-an only spent one night on this? That's amazing!''
*''There's no way I could be that fast...''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Mi-an only spent one night on this? That's amazing!
|Don't sell yourself short, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=There's no way I could be that fast...
|Don't sell yourself short, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Hmm... I see. Next question.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Regardless, Owen must've had to pay Mi-an for working overnight. ''Player'', tell me how much that would've been.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Ah, well, be that as it may, kind lady that she is, Mi-an gave me a discount! The difference in the bill was so small, I almost forgot about it!}}

*''I dunno, maybe it was... free?''
*''Yeah, just a little more than usual.''
*''We charge out the wazoo!''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I dunno, maybe it was... free?
|Owen says he was charged slightly more, and you're saying there was no overnight expedient charge...?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Ahah, silly me! I guess there was no overnight fee, I must've just imagined that part!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Uh huh...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=We charge out the wazoo!
|As I suspected. Owen, you really shouldn't be trying to hide the truth from me, you know...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Ah, er, well, to me, it was such a negligable amount that I just forgot about it, that's it.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|Hm...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|OK. Next question.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Grace, Grace, Grace, enough with the third degree... there's really nothing more to be said-}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Boss, you sure have a lot to say for someone who says there's nothing to say; why do you always butt in whenever I ask ''Player'' a question, huh? It's starting to seem like you two are in cahoots.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Haha! Cahoots? I mean, what even is a "cahoot," really? I think this whole ordeal has you on edge, but, alright, have it your way! I'll zip it! Continue with the interrogation, please!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|If something like this happened in the Commerce Guild, would your boss, Yan, handle it like Owen? Which is to say, would he insist on paying the damages out of his own pocket?}}

*''No flippin' way.''
*''I don't really know...''
*''Of course, Yan is a boss with a big heart!''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=No flippin' way.
|Er, well, you never know! Remember when you first got to Sandrock and Yan was there waiting with open arms? Why, he must've walked over 12 steps from his desk to-}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|What happened to "zip it?"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Ah, I did say that. Those are words, said by me...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=I don't really know...
|Yeah, but the thing is, ''Player''. I think you do.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Of course, Yan is a boss with a big heart!
|I- Oh, no. I'm not detecting any sense of dishonesty or even irony with that answer. Note to self: this Builder has been completely brainwashed, maybe try to do something about that later...}}
