Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|In times of crisis, I'm afraid my pottery isn't of much use. People like me depend on people like you to build things like that bridge for our town. It's not much, but... you do have my gratitude.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|I hope my meager contributions to the bridge project helped you in some way. I wish I could've done more, but you know, there's only so much Salt and so many Sand Dates a construction project needs.}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|It almost brings a tear to my eye, seeing everyone in town working together like this... Times of great crisis require even greater telesis! Ooh... did I just come up with a new sermon topic...?}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Is it too late to put in my idea for the bridge? Make it a draw bridge! That way if any doomsday type train is headed for us again, we can just pull the bridge up! Y'know, instead of leavin' everything up to the hands of fate and what not... Oh. You finished it? Well, eh... next time.}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|Fine bridge we got out there now, pardner. Ya done good. When you stand up where the trams are, it's a fine spectacle to survey. And the best part? Not a Geegler in sight.}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Finally, the bridge is open! Feels like the biggest weight has been lifted. Thank the Light, we've managed to pull through!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|Outta my way! I'm havin' myself a conniption fit! I gotta go back and count up my savings... What's the cheapest train outta this dump? Er- You didn't hear nothin'!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|As the bridge was finally declared complete, a sudden sandstorm appeared. Through the haze, a figure, a silhouette, a frightful image... Sorry, I'm just thinking of a novel, any similarities are, of course, purely coincidental.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I guess with the bridge built and these tumultuous times nearly at an end I can get back to studying cooking and archeology... instead of survival skills and self-defence.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|That robot thing Qi cooked up really is something else, huh? I don't think I've ever seen that man crack a smile, but boy, he looked like a kid in a candy store jumpin' that thing all across the desert...}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Hey. I think you really impressed Heidi with the bridge; she was worried you two wouldn't have the experience but... looks like she was worried for nothin'.}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Heidi showed me how to make a truss bridge out of toothpicks! Maybe you can use my design next time!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|I'm no expert, but the new Shonash Bridge looks even better than the old one! And that new machine designed by Qi looks super interesting, I wonder if he'll let me test-drive it?}}

{{dialogue|Justice|With the Geeglers on the run and the Ataran Express coming back to Sandrock soon, I might finally get a little bit of time off. Yo, Builder: what's the weather in Highwind like this time of year...?}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|That's great, the bridge is open, and our very own Builda has done even more fine work! Y'know Rocky's always talkin' about you and Mi-an, how yous are crazy reliable and smart, kinda like him in his younger years! Haha, you shoulda seen him!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|I'm so glad them Ataran folk found the new bridge to their liking. The suspension was killing me!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|Fine work on the new Shonash Canyon Bridge, Builder! I do hope the things our townfolk were able to come up with made the job a little easier for you! Get some rest, you've earned it!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Whew! We're done with the bridge! Finally, now I can... I can... eh... Dang! We've been so busy lately, I don't even know what to do with my free time!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|Perhaps the greatest takeaway from all that's happened is that we here in Sandrock have proved our competence to the Free Cities. This should make it easier to attract businesses, investments, and the such in the coming days. Thank you for your contribution, Builder.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|These days, I'm not much for crossing the Shonash Bridge... or any bridge for that matter.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Hey, ''Player'', saw the bridge! You know, I think it's safe to say that if anybody ever had doubts about what you and Mi-an are capable of, they've been officially put to rest!}}

{{dialogue|Pablo|When the bridge was out, I couldn't wait to hop on the first train up to Atara! But now that it's fixed... kinda not feelin' it anymore. Ain't that always the way!}}

{{dialogue|Pen|What did I contribute to the bridge, you ask...? Well- I exude positive energy wherever I go, my presence alone is enough to inspire! I mean, duh.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Certain details about the opening ceremony would best be forgotten. I take it you understand?}}

{{dialogue|Rian|Finally, I can start getting some good lumber from Atara. Wait, did I finish the last job? Aw, pal, Dan-dan was right, I need to start writing things down.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Me an' my boys are glad you guys came through on that bridge project; ya know, we can't really operate here without proper livin' conditions, so... glad we still get to be neighbors, neighbor!}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|Nice bridge, Builder. Now I think I finally know what Justice meant when he said, "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Finally some good news for a change! That bridge is going to be around in Sandrock for a long time, you should be proud!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|Hey you know what? You did pretty good with that bridge! With that, you're no longer a newbie.}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|It's a good thing you finished that bridge when you did, the Moisture Farm would've run out of water pretty soon. Glad to know we can count on you.}}

Title: Sandrock is Saved! Mint Leaves!
And so, a chapter in Sandrock history comes to a calm conclusion as the Shonash Canyon Bridge is now repaired, inspected, and open once again for water transportation!

The inspection began with our sleepy little town getting just a bit sleepier as narcoleptic engineer extraordinaire, Mint, joined the township. "Sandrock is alright, I guess. Although I do find that the warm sun tends to make... me... fall... asleep... zzzzz..." Mint had to say before abruptly cutting our interview short.

Mint had planned to only be in Sandrock for a day or so until he realized he'd need to commission some equipment from our local Builders. In the meantime, Mint ran into his childhood friend, our very own Director Qi, and ended up sticking around for a little while!

"I don't know why everyone's so surprised. I'm actually considered quite popular in Vega 5. I have over two point three friends there," Qi stated, setting the record straight.

When pressed, he continued: "I define a friend as someone I correspond with at least once per year, and then divide down if interactions are less than that. Quite simple, really."

We've all been through a lot these days, but we've shown the world that Sandrock doesn't go down easy! With the Geeglers in remission and repairs in place, expect to see plenty of new faces around town as we once again enjoy that delicious, nutritious, fresh Atara and Portia water!

*''Do I get paid more in my new position?''
*''Okay, sure. Bye.'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Yan|Huh? Well, no, you'd be making exactly the same... just with this additional responsibility... It's more about the prestige! Of being promoted!}}

*''Whatever, I'll still do it.''
*''That's not fair, I won't do it.''

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|answer=Whatever, I'll still do it.

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|''Player'', as a matter of fact, there have been a lot of people complaining about the quality of your work as of late.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|I didn't want to say it but actually this task to build and place a Yakmel Stop over by the Gecko Station is a punishment.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|Do this thing for me and I'll let you off the hook for all your recent bad behavior. Gosh, you're so lucky to have a cool boss like me!}}
