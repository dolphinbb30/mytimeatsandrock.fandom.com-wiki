{{dialogue|Catori|I'm sorry, it's something for my son...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|See, I'm setting up his room for him now, and I've already commissioned Rian to make some furniture, but I may need your help with the study desk.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Alo is at an age where he's growing fast, and I worry that a fixed-height desk might not be suitable for him. So I consulted with Dr. Fang, who recommended a desk that can be adjustable in height.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|But Rian said he couldn't make that kind of desk and suggested I try asking Builders, which is why I thought of you.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Can you spare some time to help me with this? I really want to make sure everything's perfect when Alo gets here.}}

*''Sure, I'd be happy to help!''
*''I have too many things right now...''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Sure, I'd be happy to help!
|Thank you! Here's a Worktable recipe for the Adjustable Desk, Dr. Fang gave it to me. Alo really liked the model you made for him last time, and I'm sure he'll be happy to know that you're the one who created this desk as well.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|reward={{i2|Adjustable Desk|1}}|I'm counting on you for this!}}

|That's okay, I... understand. If you change your mind, please let me know.}}
