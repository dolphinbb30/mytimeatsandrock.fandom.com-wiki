Title: Costumed Criminal Caught!
"Eat marbles, marble eaters!" Famous last words.

Last words before being caught, that is! Was that enough of a hook? See for a second there, maybe you thought... Oh, alright, maybe that wasn't a great thing to do. Sorry for misleading you, but we put out a survey and apparently more than half of our readers don't make it more than halfway down the page! So, yeah. Just trying to make things more exciting.

Anyway, ''Player'' caught a bandit!

Oh, maybe that was a better hook. But in any case, yes, it's true. Apparently upon receiving a highly dubious commission, ''Player'' hit the streets looking for clues leading to the revelation of the specialist's true identity and subsequent capture! Bravo, ''Player''! 

Our hard-boiled Builder detective had this to say on the matter:

"It all stank to high heaven. I could see trouble written all over his face, and had a feeling he couldn't even spell the word if he was lookin' at it in the mirror. He fancied himself a wolf in sheep's clothing, but when he opened his mouth all I could hear was 'baa baa baa...'"

Or at least, that's what I'd expect to hear. Everyone thinks in metaphors when they're solving crimes! Unfortunately ''Player'' was not available for comment, and, well... Sorry, ''Player''! We have to get this news out while it's still hot!

Andy, the bandit boy is safely in the hands of the Civil Corps, and it is planned that he will be sent to work for the Church until he can be rehabilitated.

We eagerly await the arrival of the real specialist. Stay tuned to the Tumbleweed Standard for more updates on these situations. Are you still reading? Yay! Article's over now, thanks for reading!
