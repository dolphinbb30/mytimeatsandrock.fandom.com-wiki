{{dialogue|Qi|An ejection system?}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Yeah! It goes like "Pyyow!" And launches yer enemy, by my reckoning, no less than thirty meters!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|...The exact same force will be enacted upon the user. Your design, as it stands, will simply launch both the user and the victim thirty meters in opposite directions. While perhaps the case could be made for this being slightly amusing, this is not a practical fighting device.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|We just... up the power! Put one o' them there... "Ancient Cores" up in there! That'd sort it all out!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|It would "sort out" nothing. It would launch the user and the victim... further.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|What? Nah... I mean... Could it be?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes. Increasing power to a device amplifies all mechanisms attached, unless accounted for with redirection and inhibitors or insulation.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Well, then... account for 'em!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I will not. But you may try again.}}

{{dialogue|Andy|You will? Alriiiiiight!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|And... in the future... please educate yourself on the guidelines for proper diagram writing. Yes, it's pedantic. No, it doesn't affect the overall quality of the result but.. Tch... Professionals have standards, you see? You scribble the same as the day we met.}}
