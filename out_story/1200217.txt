Title: Important Investor's Impending Inspection
For those of you who haven't heard, esteemed and world famous business mogul, Musa, plans to visit Sandrock to talk business with Mayor Trudy! If all goes well, we hope to secure funding for a road to Portia, which, as many of you know, will allow Sandrock to ship in water much more easily! And who doesn't like water?

So, everyone mark your calendars and plan accordingly! Mayor Trudy and I will be in discussions with Musa to organize a meet and greet sometime after an initial meeting at City Hall. 

This reporter recommends that if you want anything signed, prepare it in advance. Remember that autographs written on body parts do wash off, so really consider getting an object of some sort signed. 

Be aware of personal space, don't try to touch Musa or shake his hand unless he offers first. If you have something you want to say, avoid gushy statements like "omigoshiloveyoumusa!" Go with something he would want to be known for like, "The way you helped out with the Lucien refugees, that was all class."

{{dialogue|Musa|Everyone's heard the rumors. Sandrock's on the decline. And not everyone's convinced desert greenification is possible, either. Heard from the council they have trigger bills written; ready to classify dispersed Sandrock citizens as economic migrants...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Yeah, you've got yourself a hotshot new Builder, and I'm a fan of your architect's work as well. But without good citizens behind the scenes, holding everything down, I'd tend to agree with the naysayers.}}
