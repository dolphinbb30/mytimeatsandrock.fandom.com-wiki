{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Appreciated.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|You worked on a project together?}}

|You've been working so hard to develop Sandrock, honestly, your motivation is infectious! And it's not just me... Professor Luo worked even harder than me!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, it certainly has been wonderful having you both here.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Make sure you keep me updated on the progress of the forest. There is much I believe we can learn from it. I look forward to returning in a few years to see a mighty green forest right here in the Outback.}}
