{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|...Eh, anyway! I'm going to start talking to restaurant owners in other cities. Meanwhile, feel free to start selling the recipe around here in Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Maybe you can work something out with that saloon guy, what's his name? Joe? Just don't sell the recipe for anything less than 200 Gols, got me? Okay, we're pals now, so I'm gonna share with you a couple of tricks of the trade...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|First rule of making a deal: you gotta ease into it, {{textcolor|green|don't just strike straight to the heart of the matter}}, ask 'em about their family or something, remember how I did? Second rule: {{textcolor|green|always let 'em know that you've got other options}}! Make 'em desperate!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|That's all, I'll be on my way. I'll send you any profit share later.}}
