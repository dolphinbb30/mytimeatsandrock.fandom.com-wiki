{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|How fortunate of us to have crossed paths; it just so happens that you're my first customer of the day!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Tell me, how's your brother doing?}}

*''Great! Thanks for asking.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''I don't have a brother...?'' (No unique dialogue)
*''Not good, actually.'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Perfect! That reminds me: I'm looking for someone to co-operate with on a little side-gig of mine... if you're the right person for the job, there could be a lot of profit to be made! Want to hear my offer?}}

*''Sure, let's hear it.''
*''Nah, too much on my plate.''

{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|answer=Nah, too much on my plate.
|Are you quite sure? Hm, well I'm sure someone else will be happy to take me up on my very generous offer...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|You know of cooking, right? Basically, it's building, with food! Hence my interest in working with you. No, no. No need to find a professional chef. That'll be too pricey.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Anyway, I was traveling through Seesai, and I picked up a few of their signature peppers! They range from the super spicy to the hyper numbing to the ultra pungent, all uniquely delicious, borderline nutritious, and go well with just about any dish!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|And by any dish, in this case, I mean noodles. As something of a noodle connoisseur myself, I have a keen nose for what makes them "pop." My thoughts are that these peppers may very well hold the key to reaching noodle nirvana!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|But why stop at just filling our stomachs when we could fill our wallets as well? Ho ho... I'm sure that once someone creates the dish I have in mind, people'll be lining up for decades just to get one whiff of 'em! Me? Oh, I don't cook.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|Which brings me to my point! You have a Cooking Station, that makes you as qualified as anyone! Once you get the dish right, I'll sell the recipe all around the Free Cities. We'll do it real fair, real amicable-like, nice and square: seventy thirty!}}

*''Sounds good.''
*''I'll do it if it's 50:50.''
*''Too much on my plate, sorry.''

{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|answer=Sounds good.
|Wonderful! I knew you were the reasonable type!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|Good! It's a deal then! Now! My only hope is that you might succeed where others have failed...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|For this dish, let me be as precise as possible: you'll first need a {{textcolor|green|bone}} broth as the base and the noodles should be hand-made with {{textcolor|green|flour}}. Before boiling them, you'll need to add some {{textcolor|green|leafy vegetables}}, as well as some seasoned {{textcolor|green|fresh meat}}...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|Then, it's time to add my Seesai peppers! I've blended eighteen peppers and spices together to make my own {{textcolor|green|secret seasoning}}. My senses are tingling just thinking about it. Builder, if you pull this off, we'll become a part of culinary history.}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|In any case, you'd best figure this out in the next three days. You know how I roll, right? Can't stay in any place for more than three days. Usually it's two: I'm doin' you a favor here. Plus, there are others out there who can build things with food, you know...}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|Come find me when you've created the dish!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|answer=I'll do it if it's 50:50.
|Well, well, someone's acting shrewd! I tell you what, I'm in a good mood today, and I like your backbone, 50/50 it is! I'll concede a bit and give you my peppers, but don't think my first offer wasn't fair, now!}}
{{dialogue|Mysterious Man|indent=true|Good! It's a deal then! Now! My only hope is that you might succeed where others have failed...}}

|A full plate indeed leaves little room for noodles... Hm, well I'm sure someone else will be happy to take me up on my very generous offer. If you change your mind, come find me before I find someone else!}}
