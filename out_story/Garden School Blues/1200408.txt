{{dialogue|Zeke|We're lucky to have you here, Nia. We've always had to kind of wing it over here. Having insight from Highwind is really helpful.}}

{{dialogue|Nia|''Player''! You came too?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|It's so beautiful here! Oh, and I guess its full of resources, haha! That must be great for you Builders! I just came to check up on the Saxoul trees. If you need some help, let me know.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Wow, I remember this! Look at how young I was! Still so hopeful... haha, I'm kidding! My time at Botanical School was hard work, but it was really a lot of fun.}}

*''You worked so hard at school.''
*''So how did you meet Professor Luo?''
*''I don't think I've seen a picture of you at school before.''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=You worked so hard at school.
|Well, coming from you that's something...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|But yeah, it was really rough.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Whenever things got difficult, I thought about you working tirelessly in Sandrock. Fighting for your dream... and I pushed through.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|So I guess in a way... you're my mentor, haha! You accompanied me all those years.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=So how did you meet Professor Luo?
|Professor Luo and I have a bit of a weird story. I failed a few theory classes, and I really thought I wouldn't make it into the mentor program.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|It turns out that the farmer that'd be giving me advice the whole time was Professor Luo...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Later on Professor Luo said he'd been watching me. He said that it's not all grades... perseverance and dedication to planting was something he didn't see in just everyone.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|It feels a little weird to be complimenting myself like this haha...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|You know... I told the Professor that you inspired me to push myself like I do!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=I don't think I've seen a picture of you at school before.
|After I watched you leave on that train and I went to Botany School, it felt like we were worlds apart.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|And it was the first time that we weren't by each other's side...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|But it turned out well! Look at us now, fully functioning adults!}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''You really helped me here, too.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''That's what friends are for!'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Nia|Yeah! We can both work to push each other to be the best we can be!}}
