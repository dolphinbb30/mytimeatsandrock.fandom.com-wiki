{{dialogue|Miguel|''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I do hope you're enjoying your "victory." These benighted gunslingers are dooming the human race once again. I can't foresee another ending to this little parable.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Why did you do this?''
*''You're just bitter you lost.''
*''We saved the town...''
*''Why would you do this to me? I loved you...''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=Why did you do this?
|I thought that was clear. Duvos provide the structure and order needed to prevent another calamity caused by human capriciousness. You should be grateful that I tried to bring order to Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|For too long Sandrock has been an unchecked town, full of unabashed attempts at "progress" with whatever dangerous technology and ideologies dug up from underground.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=You're just bitter you lost.
|Sigh... It's not about me. I regret that neither you nor Duvos are on the same page as me, but I believe that Light will triumph over darkness.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=We saved the town...
|From what? You have "saved" this town from an actual future. And even though they betrayed me, do you really think Duvos won't come again?}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=Why would you do this to me? I loved you...
|I did love you. Truly. I thought you saw the world in the same way as me. Saw that we're just repeating the same mistakes of our forebears. But you fell for their words. You fell for their hedonistic delusion of "freedom."}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|Sometimes, my dear, we must make a sacrifice for the future of mankind. I'm sorry for what happened, but I will not be so selfish as to prioritize my feelings over what is right.}}
{{dialogue|Player|indent=true|(What should I say?)}}

:*''Why did you do this?''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=double|answer=We saved the town...
|From what? You have "saved" this town from an actual future. And even though they betrayed me, do you really think Duvos won't come again?}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|You people are short-sighted. Your efforts will be in vain when the shrouds of darkness caused by the human need for ever more fall upon the world once more.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I was not just trying to save your lives, but the lives of all children for generations to come.}}

*''You're lying.''
*''How were you saving us? You worked for Duvos!''
*''(Listen)''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=You're lying.
|What purpose would lying hold? What could I possibly be lying about? I am here, sitting in a cage. I'm being very sincere.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=How were you saving us? You worked for Duvos!
|Sigh. The Duvos Emperor saw things the same way I did. Or at least I had believed. I... never wanted to hurt anyone, I wanted to save everyone.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Ultimate freedom... hedonism, was what the people during the Age of Corruption practiced. In the name of "freedom" they built weapons and technology that we can't even imagine!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|They were so busy asking if they could, they never stopped to think if they should! In the end, in the name of "freedom" they fought a war that wrought destruction on our world.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|They did not care for the consequences of their actions. They did not care that they were damning future generations.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|The people of the Free Cities are repeating these sins. With utter disregard they flaunt relics of the past and spit in the face of our collective future.}}

*''Duvos use relics too!''
*''But it's only in defense.''
*''Just listen.''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=Duvos use relics too!
|The Duvos government strictly controls who can salvage their relics. They took painstaking steps to ensure that any newfound technology is always under government control. It's not ideal... but it's still better than what we have here.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|At least... I still hope that's the case.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=But it's only in defense.
|Ah, the classic retort, of course. I am sure the populace of the Age of Corruption would have said the same thing. We are simply using our technology of mass destruction in defense against our enemies.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I tried to warn the people of this town that their actions were leading them to another calamity. My sermons fell upon deaf ears... I tried to evacuate all the people through my plot, but that plan failed.}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|So I shall pay for my righteousness. I understand in their view, I did harm to Sandrock. I shall face whatever this town wishes, for I will not abandon my beliefs.}}

*''Matilda and Pen abandoned you.''
*''Duvos doesn't care about you.''
*''Maybe you're right.''

{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|answer=Matilda and Pen abandoned you.
|...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|indent=true|I am tired now, Builder. I would like you to leave.}}
