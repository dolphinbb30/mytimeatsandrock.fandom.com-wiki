{{dialogue|Burgess|The new noodles at the Blue Moon are well and good, but whenever I get a whiff of that smell coming out the window, I start drooling like a puppy at a hot-dog eating competition! Not good for staying hydrated! I do love them, though...}}

{{dialogue|Grace|That dish you made is really great. There's a lot of feeling to it... at first it seems simple, but it certainly isn't. And you said you just started cooking recently? (sigh) No, no. You should be proud. I'm happy for you.}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Where does that Owen come up with them wild ideas of his? "Drool With Joy?" Corny name, but them Seesai folk really know how to spice up a plate, I tell you what! I gotta get that recipe!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hey, ''Player''! Strange news! The Mysterious Man wants me to be the spokesperson for the "Drool With Joy" noodles! He said he was inspired by my ability to fight through the spice...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|But really I just thought they're kinda... nice? Hot, but not too hot. But what do you think? Me, a spokesperson! I don't know if I can handle the limelight, but on the other hand, I do get all the noodles I can eat...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|The "Drool With Joy" noodles have been a hit! They're pretty much a staple over at the saloon now! Everytime I start makin' it, it takes every fiber of my being to stop myself from snagging a bite! Can't believe I almost passed on the idea...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Recently I've been training my guts! That's right, have you tried the "Drool With Joy" noodles over at the Blue Moon yet? Hm, what's that? You invented them? Alright, alright, good for you... but you know: no one likes a braggart, ''Player''?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I mean, you don't have to go around beating your chest about every little accomplishment... Where was I? Ah, yes! I'm training my guts! Even my iron intestines are no match for the heat of those noodles. Indeed, they pass through me like an avalanche.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|This is unacceptable! I will overcome this challenge as I have others before!}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Cooking is a funny thing. Sometimes you can forego the recipebook and end up with something spectacular. The "Drool With Joy" noodles seem to really exemplify that. Hopefully one day I can come up with something that good...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Lately I've been training my guts! That's right, the spicy new noodle dish at the Blue Moon has proven to be more than a match for my otherwise iron intestines. But I'll win in the end, I always do! Oof... hold that thought. Bathroom.}}
