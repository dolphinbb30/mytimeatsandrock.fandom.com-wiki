{{dialogue|Grace|''Player'', you came to see me off? I wanted to come and talk to you yesterday, but you just seemed so busy.}}

*''(Stay to say goodbye)''
*''(Make an excuse and leave)''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=(Make an excuse and leave)
|No problem, I don't want to hold you. I'm just happy I got to see you before I left. Take care of yourself.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|You know, I actually didn't want you guys to see me off... I even told Logan the wrong time. I'm not good at this kinda stuff.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|But honestly, when I saw you coming, I was really happy. Sigh... sometimes, I wonder if I'm really suitable for this job.}}

*''Why would you say that?''
*''No one else could do your job.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Why would you say that?
|I feel like I've changed. I'm not the person I used to be. My training was all about suppressing your emotions, embracing solitude, and putting the mission before anything else. I don't know, I feel kind of distant to all that now.}}

:*''Change is a good thing.''
:*''If you want to stay, just quit!''
:*''Haha, you're just nervous about seeing your boss.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=double|answer=Change is a good thing.
|A good thing? I don't know. Maybe for a citizen, but for an agent getting ready for her next assignment...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=double|Wait, I shouldn't unload all of this on you. Sorry.}}

::*''I understand, Grace.''
::*{{flirt}}''I just care because you're important to me.''
::*''(Stay silent)''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=3|answer=I understand, Grace.
|Thank you.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=3|answer=I just care because you're important to me.
|I know, I feel the same way about you.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=double|answer=If you want to stay, just quit!
|Hahaha, that'd be nice! But I... can't right now. Too much responsibility.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=double|Maybe some time in the future. When my job's done... when that time comes, I think I'd like to come back to Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=double|answer=Haha, you're just nervous about seeing your boss.
|Maybe... my boss is pretty intense.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=No one else could do your job.
|Haha, maybe. I am pretty good at it. Still, my training was all about suppressing your emotions, embracing solitude, and putting the mission before anything else. I don't know, I feel kind of distant to all that now.}}
