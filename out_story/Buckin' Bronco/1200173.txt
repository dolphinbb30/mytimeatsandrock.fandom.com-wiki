Title: The Specialist and You: Why This Seemingly Bad Thing is Actually Good
Following the portentous temporary relocation of everyone's favorite church lady, City Hall was pressed to make some changes with the current security arrangement within Sandrock. The decision has been made to hire a specialist, someone to help the Civil Corps find the perpetrator of said portentous pilferage. However, this decision has been met with mixed responses. 

"You know, honestly, me and Unsuur are happy to get the help. Plus a chance to work with a professional; we're not too big to admit we need an expert out here on the case," remarked Sheriff Justice. But others were less optimistic, and in some cases, just confused.

"I mean do we really need a specialist? I think everyone's plenty special already!" said Burgess of the situation, who clearly has a deep misunderstanding of everything that is going on.

"Specialist is just code for bounty hunter. We're bringing in one monster to deal with another; this won't end well," Zeke suggested in a foreboding manner.

So we here at the Tumbleweed Standard decided to do a bit of a deep dive, a little bit of investigative journalism on the subject to put everyone's fears to rest. Or, perhaps to confirm them. But ideally the former.

A concern many people seem to have is that this specialist might be a dangerous person, someone who might put Sandrock in harm's way at the expense of catching his target. We began by reaching out to some other specialists to see what kind of reputation he's garnered for himself. 

First we got in touch with Jerry 'The Foot,' who had this to say: 

"Yeah all us bounty hunters, I mean, oh, yeah you said I should say... specialists, we get cool nicknames. Like me, they call me 'The Foot' cause I always stamp out my enemies! And I kinda smell. But that's a gland problem, I can't really help that and don't like it when people bring it up."

Yeah, anyway, there's Jo Triggerfingers, they call him that cuz he'll fire a weapon at you with any one of his fingers, yeah he holds his iron all sorts of ways, really surprises folk. There's Madhab the Mouth, he's always talkin'. Jengo Two-hands, well, that one don't need explainin', but ah... yeah Bronco the Kid, we always called him that cuz, ah... I mean, yeah he's like a kid. Like got the mental capacity of a child. He thought we were givin' him a cool cowboy name, but nah, we were makin' fun of him. Uh, great guy, though. I do hear he catches criminals. Y'know. Sometimes. 

"Is he dangerous? Nah, not really, I don't think you folks got anything to worry about in that department. I'd just keep your receipt, know what I mean? Just in case."

This interview really put us at ease. Sure, it would be nice to know we were getting someone with a bit more of a reputation for actually catching criminals, but this reporter would argue that it shouldn't be at the expense of bringing a wildcard into town, eh? Can we make these assessments based on just one person's opinion? Well, Jerry 'the Foot' tapped out that whole interview in such colloquial language over the telegraph. How could anyone with such dexterous wordsmithing abilities be wrong?
