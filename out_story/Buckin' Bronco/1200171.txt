{{dialogue|Kid|Howdy there, partner. You the Builder 'round these parts? The name's Bronco. Bronco the Kid. I'm here by the request of your Mayor to track down those handsome devils that are giving y'all such a headache, and I'm gonna need your help to do it.}}

*''Happy to help.''
*''Handsome devils?''
*''You look kinda familiar...''

{{dialogue|Kid|indent=true|answer=Happy to help.
|Glad to hear you're on the side of law and order, partner.}}
{{dialogue|Kid|indent=true|answer=Handsome devils?
|Er, well, yes. I couldn't help but notice from the wanted posters I seen that the bandits y'all are goin' up against are particularly good looking. Not that I'm gonna let that get in the way of my work er nothin'...}}
{{dialogue|Kid|indent=true|answer=You look kinda familiar...
|Ah hah! Well, as you know, I am pretty darn famous around these parts for uh... you know, all the cool stuff I do! No need to remind you what that is, as I'm sure you are very familiar already. No time for autographs, I got, uh... adult job stuff to do. For big people. Like me.}}
{{dialogue|Kid|In any case, what I'm gonna need from you is a Super Shock Shield! Or "sss" for short! Which also means 'shield' in the Geegler language. At least, I think of it as meanin' that. It's got like... there's a lot of layers to it...}}
{{dialogue|Kid|reward={{i2|Super Shock Shield|1}}|What for? To aid me in the capture of these handsome devils, of course. Did you even need to ask? Anyway, I've already gone to the trouble of having that uppity science feller design somethin' for you to work with; so here you go.}}
{{dialogue|Kid|The sooner you get it done, the sooner I can go after those dashing rogues! Curse them, and their ravishing good looks! So long, workshop ownin'... Builder-type person!}}
