{{dialogue|Trudy|Thank you all for coming. We have a situation at the Portia tunnel. As the construction team was tunneling through to the other side, monsters started to enter. The construction is currently on hold until we can deal with the monsters.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I have called this emergency meeting to try and find a solution.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Heidi, can you give us a bit more detail?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Sure. Well, I wasn't there at the time, but from what my workers were telling me, the monsters bursted in as soon as they made a hole to the other side of the range. They must've been attracted by the noise.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Yeah, makin' a lotta noise is like puttin' a light in front of a moth when it comes to predators. Shouldn't have done that. I reckon you should have asked me for some advice.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Oh yeah, where were you when we were building this tunnel project?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Right... sorry.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Is there a way to get them out?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Well, I suppose we could go in guns ablazing, but what's to keep the monsters out of the tunnel for good?}}
{{dialogue|Logan|I could pitch a tent there at the entrance.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|That's actually a pretty-}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Don't be stupid!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|...Bad idea.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Once the tunnel's done, I reckon the difference in pressure on the two sides of the range will cause a major draft through the tunnel. That'll continue to attract the monsters from the Southern Eufaula.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Unless you plan on campin' there forever, I've got a better idea.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Shoot.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Howlett wrote of a Monster Whistle, know of it? It's supposed to produce a range of high frequencies that can keep most monsters away.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|The way I figure it, we'll need three of 'em in the tunnel to keep the monsters out. The wind goin' through will power them.}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Anyway, I jus' need help from a Builder to put 'em together, then we can head in to the tunnel to install 'em. We got the tunnel sealed off, so shouldn't be any danger, but I reckon we oughta be quick about it still.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|That's a great idea, I concur.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Way to go, Else!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Justice, what do you think? After the Martle Duck incident, I trust Elsie to get it done.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I agree, Elsie can take care of herself. Still, I'd prefer if the Civil Corps went-}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I'll take Logan!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|I mean, I'll go with Logan, he's a monster hunter, right? It's his job!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I don't see why not...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Wait a minute, Trudes, I'm still tryin' to do my community service and-}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Oh my heck, are you still spewin' that nonsense? You're one of us now, so you'd better take care of Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Please, Logan, you have the most experience out of all of us when dealin' with monsters of the desert.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Come on partner, just accept it. Now that you're back, we can focus on our task of keepin' the order! Just like old times!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Fine, Trudy, I'll do it.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Elsie, you also need a Builder right? Why don't you work with ''Player''. They're also a Civil Corps member. Is that fine, ''Player''?}}
