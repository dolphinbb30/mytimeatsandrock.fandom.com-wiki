{{dialogue|Justice|So whaddya think?}}

*''You look really stable.''
*''You look so cool!''
*''Wow, good shot!''
*''Uh... pew pew?''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=You look really stable.
|That's right. My stance gives me complete control. I'm stable enough to reduce the recoil, and my aim is solid.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=You look so cool!
|Ah... haha, well, I mean... I wasn't fishin' for compliments or nothin'... Ahem. Thanks! Lookin' cool when shootin's part of the job, I guess... haha!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Wow, good shot!
|Yeah, it's all about controlling your breathin' and holdin' a strong stance and grip. After that, it's just aim an' fire.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Anyway... uh...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Uh... pew pew?
|Yeah, the pew pew comes from this end here and... Hey! C'mon, you gotta take this seriously, okay? If yer gonna come out with us again, I need to know I can rely on you.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|A strong stance is really the first important step. If you aren't in control, your aim is gonna be all over the place, if you aren't holdin' strong, then that recoil is gonna be kickin' you onto your backside real quick.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Y'know, you shoulda seen my old boss shoot. Guy could shoot the goggles off a Geegler an' not even draw blood. Heck, I seen folks just throw down their weapons after a look from the guy!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Anyway. Next up is grip. Grip is just as important as your stance, alright? With a weak grip, that gun of yours'll kick right outta your hands when you shoot.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|During Unsuur's training, gun shot outta his hand an' knocked out a couple teeth. Had to get 'em replaced, don't remember which ones though...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|You want to cover all the gaps on the grip with your hands. Get your main hand holding the gun, thumb pointing forward. Get it right up there, don't hold too low, now.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Next up wrap your other hand around, makin' sure you're supporting it. Also means you got the freedom to react if necessary.}}

*''Like this?''
*''Easy.''
*{{flirt}}''Can you come and show me?''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Like this?
|Yeah that's it. Now when you're holding it properly, you're not gonna get as much recoil, you'll be controlled.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Once you got your stance and grip down, well, that's the basics. There's much more to shootin' than this, mind, but that'll come with practice. Alright, let's have a little competition, eh?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Easy.
|Haha, I like your confidence! Jus' don't blame me if ya lose a couple teeth!}}

{{dialogue|Justice|Every day I'm tryin' to be half the man he was... well, I mean, with his missin' eye, leg, an' arm... I guess all I have to be is jus' a quarter of a man? Dang, an' I can't even get that!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Unsuur came shortly after that, never met the old man, but he fit in to the Civil Corps well enough, an' we were lackin' for members at the time.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Main thing B3 taught me about guns, though? Safety. Last lesson, an' by far, most important.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Number one: trigger discipline. You keep that finger off the trigger 'less your aiming to shoot.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Don't want you takin' a trip to Fang's 'cause you shot your own foot off by bein' careless. Let alone what you could do to others.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Number two: never, I repeat never, aim your gun at somethin' you ain't fixin' to take down. These things ain't toys, pardner. That's an order straight from Civil Corps. I ain't messin' around. You hear me?}}
