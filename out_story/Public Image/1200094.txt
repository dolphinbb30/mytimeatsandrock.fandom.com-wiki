{{dialogue|Owen|I heard from a friend in Atara that there are a lot of nasty rumors about Sandrock circulating in that city! Some of 'em are really out there!}}

{{dialogue|Owen|So you know me, I came up with a plan that in one fell swoop not only will dispel these nasty rumors, but also bring in some more visitors... I'm talkin' landscape photography, baby!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|We can take some nice landscape photos around Sandrock to show people what really goes on around here. Then I'll send these photo to my friend, and he'll get them published in the Atara Times!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Once people see how nice it is here, I reckon all those rumors'll have no ground to stand on and just fade away on their own... What do you think, can you help me take some photos?}}
