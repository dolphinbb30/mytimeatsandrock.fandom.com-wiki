Title: Gunky Green Gorge Goo Gas Gone! Tunnel Talks Triumphant!
Once again, ''Player'' has led a successful dive into a new ruins! Well. Let's call them outdoor ruins? Eh, whatever the case, ''Player'' cleaned all the gunk out of the Valley of Whispers! Which has led to a sharp decline in incidents of what Sandrock doctors have labelled "Green-itis." It is expected that Green-itis will be soon completely eradicated.

Impressed with with our ability to greenify and also... de-greenify where need be, Musa has decided to pull the trigger on our road deal! This road to Portia will be one of the most important undertakings in recent Sandrock history, and it marks a turning point in our future as well. Yes, folks, there has never been a better time to believe in Sandrock than right now. Investors take note!

Musa has said that he does intend to stick around as we begin the project, which is nice. I mean. Isn't he the CEO of like five companies? Seems a little odd that he can just take a bunch of time off to watch us pass his little tests or whatever, but who am I to criticize?

{{dialogue|Mint|Heidi and I can still get across to do our survey job, but I think for actual construction to start, we'll need that bridge pass {{textcolor|green|reinforced}} to ensure its structural integrity.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|We're hoping you could do that for us.}}

*''Sure.''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Sure.
|Thanks! I have some basic Worktable recipes and Assembly Station diagrams with me. I think they should be enough to reinforce the bridge pass.}}

|Mr. Musa said you'd agreed to be the primary Builder for this project, so I'll leave some basic Worktable recipes and Assembly Station diagrams with you. I think they should be enough to reinforce the bridge pass.}}
