Title: Esteemed Senior Seized, Saved, Subsequently Seems, Sensibly, Semi-Snappish
It was a monumental day in Sandrock history. It began with a celebration for the culmination of the largest breakthrough in anti-desertification achievement in over fifty years. The event was undermined, soured, by none other than the infamous Logan of the Logan Gang.

Despite being in top form surrounding the event, somehow Logan was able to slip through Civil Corps patrols and abduct Minister Matilda of the Church of the Light, a brave lodestar of leadership through these troubled times, much to the horror of the standers-by.

Matilda is, of course, safe and sound now, recovering from the ordeal. She is however reportedly, "quite miffed about the whole ordeal," which is completely understandable.

In an extraordinary display of skill and quick wit, Sheriff Justice tagged Logan's horse with a piece of catnip, difficult to detect with the human eye, but practically unmissable to a feline nose.

In this way, our town's most talented fighters made their way after Captain, who was hot on the trail. The Civil Corps along with ''Player'', the multi-talented Builder were first on the scene; they made the decision to push forward before losing too much time, and sure enough, they came face to face with the bandit king.

What ensued next was no doubt a battle for the ages, but the only witnesses of the brawl were the participants themselves.

''Player'' and Justice were not available for comment, but fortunately, this reporter was able to get in touch with deputy-in-training, Unsuur of the Civil Corps for a first hand account of the events.

"Yeah so first, ''Player'' went in, and we all followed, and then we started to hear Logan talking to someone, and then we heard a scream, and we all thought they were hurting Matilda, and then Logan was all like 'Rah!' and Justice was like, "No way, pal," and ''Player''... well, ''Player'' didn't say anything but they were looking cool, and then Logan was like 'Rahhh!' so then I was like 'punch, punch, kick!' and then Justice was like 'pew pew pew' and ''Player'' was like 'check out this move,' and then Logan was like 'pow crash swoosh pshew,' and then Pen showed up and Pen was like 'Heh heh heh... Playtime is over...' and then Logan was like 'uh oh,' then he was like 'pshew!' and then the roll-y thing was like 'weowewoewoeowo,' and Matilda was like 'Aiieeee!' then Logan was like 'Boom, better luck next time, suckers!' Those might not have been his exact words but it was something kinda hurtful like that."

A truly harrowing tale. Let us all pray that there will soon be an end to this violence.
