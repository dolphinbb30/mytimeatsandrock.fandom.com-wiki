{{dialogue|Grace|Hey! ''Player''! So...! My custom drinks are a hit! Owen thinks they're great, and... long story short, I'm going to open a little booth right out in front of the Blue Moon!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Yeah! I'm thinking it'll be a nice way to kind of "retire." Just sit behind the juice bar, squeeze fresh fruit into a glass, listen to folk tell me their stories...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Can you help me with {{textcolor|green|the booth}}? I think you'd just need a few materials and you could pop one up right there by the Blue Moon. Whaddya say? Should be no trouble for the hero Builder of Sandrock!}}

*''This looks like a job for me!''
*''Ah, I can't right now, actually...''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=This looks like a job for me!
|Great! I've got a few final things I can get ready, but... when you have the materials you need, go ahead and build up the booth {{textcolor|green|outside the Blue Moon.}}}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Ah, I can't right now, actually...
|Oh. No problem. Let me know if your schedule clears up!}}
