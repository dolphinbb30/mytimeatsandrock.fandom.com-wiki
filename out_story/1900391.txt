{{dialogue|Verna|Ahhh, I knew it...!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|You're not mad?}}
{{dialogue|Verna|You kiddin' me? I'm furious. But if there's one thing I've learned about you, Heidi... you're just gonna do what you're gonna do, so... water under the bridge.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Thanks... for understanding.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Yeah, yeah. So this is all your stuff, huh? Ah hah. I recognize that one from your blueprints. That's the school, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|That's correct! One of the best educational facilities in the Eufaula. State-of-the-art!}}
{{dialogue|Verna|This is the "state" of art, isn't it...}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Did you really have to make it so... square? I mean it wouldn't have killed you to do something with that fence. It's just... four slabs of concrete.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|The Mayor and I decided the budget would be better put towards learning materials... We have a lot of underprivileged kids from out in the desert coming here to learn.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|I see. I'll cease sharing this series of scathing scholia, lest I seem like a stoney-hearted swine... Subject change: who's your Builder...?}}

|Hey! Don't poach my people! ''Player'', with Sandrock where it is now, we can match Verna's offer...}}
{{dialogue|Verna|indent=true|I wouldn't be so sure of that, but... I can see I've struck a nerve. Alright. Offer withdrawn. But only out of courtesy for my old friend here.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Well. Don't be too proud of yourself, Heidi. You got lucky.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Hey, hey... easy now! I'm not sayin' it was all luck, but... Look! A lot of stars aligned to make this all happen for you. You remove one piece of the puzzle, the whole tower comes crashin' down.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Take your Builder, ''Player'', here for example. Whaddya do without 'em, huh? One missing piece, house of cards. Crash. Bang. Boom. Ex-cetera. Ya done.}}

*''No brag, just fact!''
*''Heidi would've found a way.''
*''You're so... rude!''

{{dialogue|Verna|indent=true|answer=No brag, just fact!
|Well, don't you get too big for your britches either, ''Player''. What do you got without one of the Free Cities' best architects drawin' up all your plans?}}
{{dialogue|Verna|indent=true|answer=Heidi would've found a way.
|Pretty sure ninety-nine percent of everybody would disagree with ya, but... you know what? I guess we'll never know.}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|I am. What are you gonna do about it? File a complaint with the Institute? I am the Institute!}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Make no mistake, I ain't tryin' to take away what you all done. It's incredible. But like I said, ya can't just ignore the series of fortunate events that led to your success...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Eh, it was a mixed bag. Certainly I prefer having you, ''Player'', in every concievable scenario, but I'd like to think we could've maybe squeaked by if it weren't for the whole "conspiracy to dry up the town" thing...}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Yeah, alright. I can concede that. Meh. It may surprise you, but in fact I did not come here to argue... So I'll say no more on the matter.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Feedback received.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Heidi! You really tick me off. But dang it, you're a heck of an architect. I'm proud of ya.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Ha... I'll take that.}}
{{dialogue|Verna|Good! 'Cause it's all you're gonna get! Now let's get to celebratin'. Where's a place to sit down? My butt's killin' me.}}
