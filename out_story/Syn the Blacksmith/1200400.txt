{{dialogue||This Workshop and I welcome you. Through your actions, you have proven yourself worthy of these knightly weapons: the only set I've ever crafted.}}
{{dialogue||The sentries that I created and stationed here to guard my Workshop have fulfilled their purpose. I do hope they didn't cause any undue trouble...}}
{{dialogue||I have no idea how much time will have passed before they would see action.}}
{{dialogue||Know that these armaments were crafted for a dear friend, in an age long past, for the sole purpose of defending the innocent and protecting everything precious in life.}}
{{dialogue||Please use these weapons with that in mind. I trust that you will, as you have likely protected others from the sentries that were here to test you.}}
{{dialogue||Stay true to these actions and ideals and prove yourself worthy of the title of hero.}}
