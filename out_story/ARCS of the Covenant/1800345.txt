{{dialogue|Burgess|Oh! Hello, ''Player''! Lovely day today, isn't it? Then again, isn't every day lovely in fabulous Sandrock!?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Um. I've actually been meaning to tell you about something...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|You see, I consider a lot of people to be my friend, even if they don't always feel the same way about it, but you... I think you're my bestest friend in the whole wide world!}}

*''Glad you feel that way.''
*''We barely know each other...''
*''You're my bestest friend, too!''

{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=Glad you feel that way.
|Yeah! I just know we're gonna be friends forever!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=We barely know each other...
|Oh... Yeah, sorry, I guess I do sort of rush into things. But... I really do consider you to be a great friend to me!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=You're my bestest friend, too!
|Yahoo! Bestfriendsayswhat-}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|...Whaaaat? Haha! I'm so glad we're official!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|A-and... when you're around...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I feel like I can do anything!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|So... Here's my idea... if you're up for it!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|It's probably not news to you that sometimes out in the desert there are wild ARCS roaming around! You remember ARCS, right?}}

*''Arid Remote-control Cars.''
*''Abnormally Reticulated Camels.''
*''At-risk Citizens.''

{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=Arid Remote-control Cars.
|Oh. No... but that does sound interesting!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|Don't worry, I'll remind you: At-risk Citizens... of Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=Abnormally Reticulated Camels.
|Oh. No... but that does sound interesting!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|Don't worry, I'll remind you: At-risk Citizens... of Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=At-risk Citizens.
|reward={{NPC2|Burgess|rp=2}}|Correct! Ooh... just hearing you say it sends shivers down my spine... I shouldn't have even asked!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|You know the type... Tree-choppers, cactus poachers, lunchbag-stealers, litter bugs, jaywalkers, jugglers, and worst of all...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Water-wasters!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|So I'd like to commission from you a weapon... a weapon so powerful that it'll take care of those ARCS once and for all... That's right... those ARCS will be gone forever...! I'd like you to get me...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|{{textcolor|green|Some flowers!}}}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Flowers that will kill them...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|With kindness!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I believe that if we show these ARCS the beauty of life up close, well... there's no way they could continue to wallow in their ARCS-y ways! What do you say?}}

*''I'm in.''
*''Too much on my plate right now.''
*''That ain't gonna work!''

{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=I'm in.
|Fantastic! I knew I could count on you! Here are some seeds to do the deed! Plus a few extra for yourself. Just grow them in your garden like usual and let me know when you're ready to obliterate those water-wasters! ...With kindess.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=Too much on my plate right now.
|Oh, no! Plate! Let me know if you get time!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=That ain't gonna work!
|We won't know until we try, won't we? Let me know if you want to be onboard later!}}
