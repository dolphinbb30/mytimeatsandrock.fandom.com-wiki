{{dialogue|Qi|... You do have a plan, right...? Wait, wait... by the look on your face, perhaps you're not a rescuer but a fellow prisoner instead. Oh. Okay... well, you can join the club and sit over there while we wait for the proper authority to appear.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hold on, I recognize you, you're the new Builder. Hmm... perhaps we don't have to wait. With my intellect and your logistical aptitude, there may yet be new possibilities to extricate ourselves from this predicament.}}
