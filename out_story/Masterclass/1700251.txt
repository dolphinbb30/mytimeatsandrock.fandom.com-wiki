{{dialogue|Pen|Yoho! Skinny! Fancy seeing you here! In this city... where we both live!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|How sick was that front flip!?}}

*''Totally sick!''
*''Not bad.''
*''I seen better flips in a frying pan.''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Totally sick!
|Haha! Yeah! Did you see the part where I was like, "whoosh?"}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Not bad.
|Ah, shoot. You're right, Skinny! That was a nine out of ten flip at best. I should always strive for perfection! That's what I like about you, Skinny. Always pushing me to be my best!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I seen better flips in a frying pan.
|Puh! Nice one, Skinny. Whose kitchen have you been hanging out in then, mine!? Once I flipped a bean burrito the size of a bus!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|But hey, just as I saw you running about through town and ambushed you, it got me doing something I almost never do... thinking!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|We've been hanging out and chatting and you're always giving me stuff and buying things... I'm starting to think... we've become really good friends!}}

*''Totally!''
*''There's more to friendship than that...''
*''Eh, well, I mean...''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Totally!
|Ah hah! I knew I'd be able to recognize friendship if it did indeed come along!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=There's more to friendship than that...
|Is there? Ah, I'm sure I'll figure it out as we go along.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Eh, well, I mean...
|Of course we are! Aw, look, Skinny's too bashful to say it! That's what I like about you, Skinny. You're almost as humble as I am!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|So hey... I think it's confession time...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Remember how when we first met, I did a totally sick flip like I just did now and offered you a combat course?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Well... the truth of it is...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I don't really like teaching people anything. That whole tutorial shebang is really just an excuse for me to beat people up!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Hard to believe, I know...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|But say, since we're friends now, why don't I give you a real combat tutorial! Maybe I can even offer you an introduction to...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Space punch!}}

*''That sounds great!''
*''I can try.''
*''I don't really like hurting people...''
*''I was actually on my way somewhere...''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=That sounds great!
|Well, duh. Of course it's great! I came up with it!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Come, Skinny! We have much work to do!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I can try.
|There is no try, there is only do...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Come, Skinny! We have much work to do!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I don't really like hurting people...
|Puahaha! Nonsense, Skinny! There's no higher pursuit than the art of violence!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Come, Skinny! We have much work to do!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I was actually on my way somewhere...
|Ooh... yeah... Guess I did kind of ambush you. Hm...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Well, thank you, Skinny. You've given me something to, what's that word again... "think" about.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|If I jump off a building and ask someone to do something... I suppose it is possible they might've had other plans...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|Good looking out, Skinny! When you're ready for your extra special one-on-one training session with the strongest man in Sandrock, just swing on by!}}
