{{dialogue|Pen|Oh... Oh no... that's not it at all...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I... I've failed. For the first time in my life, I've failed! It feels... ew, gross, it feels really bad!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Dang it, Skinny! I've failed you! My only friend and I blew it! Makes me so mad I just want to- Grraah!}}

*''It's okay, Pen...''
*''Let me try again!''
*''Yeah, you blew it.''
*''You... alright there?''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=It's okay, Pen...
|It's not okay, Skinny! I can't fail! What will people say when they find out-}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Let me try again!
|No... I'm afraid there's no point. I've simply failed too hard as an instructor. There's no way you possibly could've gained anything from our lesson.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Yeah, you blew it.
|Hey, I don't see you teaching anyone how to space punch!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=You... alright there?
|No, Skinny, I am not alright! Y... You don't know what it's like-}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Deep breaths, Pen old boy... Just like the minister says... Take all those bad thoughts and push them down... deep down...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|You know what, Skinny? This is going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine. You know why?}}

*''I won't tell anyone?''
*''No one cares?''
*''Failing is a part of life?''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I won't tell anyone?
|reward={{NPC2|Pen|rp=5}}|Exactly.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=No one cares?
|What the- No!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Failing is a part of life?
|Now is not the time for joking around, Skinny!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Everyone cares about what Pen does! Everyone's always got their eye on me, just waiting for that moment for me to slip up so they can laugh! But we won't let them know, will we, Skinny? We're going to keep this all between us pals, yes?}}

*''Your secret is safe with me.''
*''I really don't think anyone cares.''

{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=Your secret is safe with me.
|That is... good to hear, Skinny. Truly, you are a stalwart companion. Trustworthy, far beyond any length I could throw you, and believe you me... that's far. Very far.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|indent=true|answer=I really don't think anyone cares.
|Ahaha! Skinny! You always know how to cheer me up with that signature Skinny brand of hilarity! Heh heh... "don't think anyone cares..." Cracks me up...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Hm... so it seems there really are things beyond even one such as myself, the glorious Protector of Sandrock...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|You know, Skinny, I've never had someone I really considered a friend before. Furthermore, I always promised myself I'd never be friends with anyone who didn't have an awesome cape, but... you made me break that promise.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Seems I couldn't predict the future... perhaps... there are many things I cannot do...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Perhaps... there is indeed a lesson here to be learned... When I got stuck looking into that mirror... failing today as a teacher... occasionally getting edged out in Whac-a-mole from time to time...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Perhaps the lesson of humility I often preach was meant for... me?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Yes... yes, that's precisely it, Skinny! I can't just take my own greatness for granted! Even though I've historically been ridiculously awesome at everything and done so effortlessly, that doesn't mean it's always going to be so!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I need to treat people better. I need to do something nice for Burgess. I...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I need to write this stuff down. Do you have a pen? I know I... said you didn't need one. I wasn't planning on having an epiphany...}}
{{dialogue|Pen|You don't? Ah, well. I'm sure I'll remember it.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Hey, look over there, a Rocket Rooster! Watch me tie its neck in a knot! Ahahaa! Smell ya later, Skinny!}}
