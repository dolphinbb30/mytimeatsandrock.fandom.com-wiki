Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Amirah|Mason never seemed like a happy man to me. I hope he finds peace somewhere.}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|I'll miss seeing Mason at the saloon after a hard day's work; he would always just stand there, brooding. But... you know, in a friendly way!}}

{{dialogue|Burgess|Mason used to always make fun of me for being so enthusiastic about telesis, and the funny thing is: a part of me is going to miss that. At least he noticed, you know?}}

{{dialogue|Catori|Mason left a pretty big tab at the Game Center on his way out. But it's alright, I forgive him... I can send him an invoice through the mail.}}

{{dialogue|Cooper|With Mason gone, the only person I can play Mah-jong with is Hugo. I reckon it'll be a bit dull, winning all the time...}}

{{dialogue|Dan-bi|You and Mi-an are already doing better than Mason in my opinion. The better the Commerce Guild becomes, the better everything runs!}}

{{dialogue|Elsie|I always thought Mason was a stick in the mud. In fact, I still do. Won't miss him. Sorry!}}

{{dialogue|Ernest|The old Builder leaving... is there some link to Logan? A mask? Hidden identities? It could be a devious plot... Hmmm...}}

{{dialogue|Grace|I didn't know Mason very well, but he was a fine enough customer. Just came in, drank his milk, paid his tab, then left without so much as a word. Wish some of our other regulars were more like that...}}

{{dialogue|Heidi|It'll be strange, having a Fireside Meeting without Mason... Wait, no, he never came to them. Actually, the Fireside Meetings will feel the same as ever.}}

{{dialogue|Hugo|Mason left you Builders with plenty to do! Think you two youngsters can handle it?}}

{{dialogue|Jasmine|Mason always smelled more like Yakmel Milk than the Yakmel do. Maybe he was part Yakmel!}}

{{dialogue|Jensen|Last I saw Mason, I asked him if he would ever come back for a visit and... he just laughed at me...}}

{{dialogue|Justice|With Mason's departure, Sandrock has lost a good saloon buddy. Not the kind of guy you'd hang out with outside of that situation, but... within the saloon community, he will be missed.}}

{{dialogue|Krystal|Ol' Mason... Though he's gone, we'll always be thinkin' of him when we're usin' all that shoddy crap he made for us!}}

{{dialogue|Mabel|Now, not everybody particularly cared for Mason, but he was one of our own. I always thought of him as like a cousin to me... a cousin I didn't particularly care for, but family, nonetheless!}}

{{dialogue|Matilda|The way you and Mi-an got that stage built back up in such a hurry has really eased my mind on Mason's leaving... Keep it up!}}

{{dialogue|Mi-an|Well, guess it's up to you and me now, huh? Don't worry, ''Player'', we've got this!}}

{{dialogue|Miguel|I do hope you had some time to pick Mason's brain before he left. Building is not some simple thing you can hope to just intuit... Yes, yes... I'm sure you'll be fine.}}

{{dialogue|Mort|That Mason sure left in a hurry. I hope he finds his peace somewhere. This life is just a rest stop, we're all only passing through. The people we won't see again... well, we can at least wish them a pleasant journey.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Mason was the Builder here in Sandrock for most of my life. Kinda makes me feel old, seeing him retire...}}

{{dialogue|Pen|Wow, Mason's really gone. Newsflash: nobody cares! Hah hah... Kidding, just kidding. He was alright.}}

{{dialogue|Rian|I used to get along with Mason well. He was a cool guy, we got the same, like, ideas and stuff. We both thought slow work is good work. Slow and steady wins the race.}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Mason left already? What the- That mop-stick owed me five Gols! Why I oughtta...}}

{{dialogue|Unsuur|One time, five years ago, Mason told me to 'don't talk to me again,' so I complied and never spoke to him again. I'd like to think I've earned his respect... though I can't truly know 'cause I can't ask.}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|What Mason lacked in manners, he made up for in... crotchetiness. He will be sorely missed.}}

{{dialogue|Yan|The Commerce Guild has lost one of its greats. Try not to feel like you're constantly living in Mason's shadow, even though you definitely,
totally, are.}}
