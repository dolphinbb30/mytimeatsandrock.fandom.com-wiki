If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Jane|After the Model Free Cities event that day, Dan-bi came to me and apologized for questioning my teaching style earlier.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I understand parents like her and I'm also not saying that my teaching style is the best. I'm... just glad that people are finally appreciative of all the effort that I've put into it.}}
