{{dialogue|Qi|Finally! How serendipitous that you were the next to fall into that cavern...}}

*''It's too dangerous for you here.''
*''Why did you come here?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=It's too dangerous for you here.
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=3}}|The potential benefits overwhelmingly outweighed the risk involved.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Why did you come here?
|Science.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|According to Civil Corps survey reports, I deduced the likelyhood of uncovering a usable Equatorial Mount in these ruins to be upwards of 99.9 percent.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Unfortunately, despite my in-depth and thoroughly digestable explanation, none of the Civil Corps members were able to comprehend the significance of an Equatorial Mount. Thusly, it became imperative that I come here myself, and hence, our untimely meeting.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|My venture proved not only unfruitful, but also has caused a delay in my research... I must be heading back to the Research Center to make up for lost time. Perhaps I'll hire someone to continue this search for me...}}

*''Let me help you!''
*''What's an Equatorial Mount?''
*''Good luck with that!''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Let me help you!
|Hm, render unto Builders the things that are Builders'... Indeed, you would be much more suited to the task. Surely you'll be able to find pieces of an {{textcolor|green|Equatorial Mount}} in the {{textcolor|green|Abandoned Ruins}}, likely on {{textcolor|green|a lower level}}...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Once you've found the pieces by diving in the ruins, you can use the {{textcolor|green|Restoration Machine at Catori's museum to make it whole again}}. Please bring it to me at that point and not before. Goodbye.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Good luck with that!
|Luck? What's luck got to do with anything? We were talking about science. Please try to stay on topic if we are ever to converse again. Goodbye.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I'm glad you asked.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|In order to facilitate the expeditious referencing and notation of celestial coordinates, a rare Old World relic is required: the Equatorial Mount.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|By aligning one rotational axis of a telescope's mount parallel to our planet's axis of rotation, an internal mechanism, known as a clock drive, will rotate the telescope over a period of a day in contrast with the rotation of our planet, in order to compensate for its motion.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Once this state has been achieved, one need only adjust the right ascension and declination dials on the Equatorial Mount to find any celestial body in the sky in only a matter of moments, based, of course, on the celestial coordinates.}}

*''Huh? Can you make it simpler?''
*''Oh. Of course.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Huh? Can you make it simpler?
|Hm. I can. But your understanding of this subject is not really relevant to the matter at hand. Perhaps another time.}}
{{dialogue||indent=true|(Your relationship is not close enough for Qi to open up about this yet.)}}
{{dialogue|Qi|In any case, I must be going. I will find some way to seek out an Equatorial Mount at a later date...}}

*''Let me help you!''
*''Good luck with that!''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Let me help you!
|Hm, render unto Builders the things that are Builders'... Indeed, you would be much more suited to the task. Surely you'll be able to find pieces of an {{textcolor|green|Equatorial Mount}} in the {{textcolor|green|Abandoned Ruins}}, likely on {{textcolor|green|a lower level}}...}}

|I see. Very well, then.}}

NPC in-mission talks:

{{dialogue|Qi|Remember, I'm not interested in simply fragments of an old relic. I want the whole device in one piece, ideally working. The Civil Corps keep bringing me rubbish. Once they even confused an actuator for a transistor! Can you believe that!?}}
