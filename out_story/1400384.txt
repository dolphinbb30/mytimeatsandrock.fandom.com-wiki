{{dialogue|Heidi|Oh, hey, ''Player''! With everything that's been going on lately, I'm taking over teaching duty again...}}

*''That's great! They need a good influence now.''
*''I hope Miguel didn't get into their heads...''

{{dialogue|Heidi|That's what I was thinking...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So, Jazz, where did you leave off with Miguel last time?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|We were talking about the history of Starbies, and how divergent evolution was accelerated by the chemicals and bioleaks left behind after the Day of Calamity.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|I remember, that were the lesson he let us draw, right?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|He said "you can try and hypothesize what other creatures could have looked like!"}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Hahahah! Do another one!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|"Now, now, Andy! How are you ever going to learn with your finger up your nose?"}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Hey!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Oh... yeah... accelerated divergent evolution... right, that ol' corker...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|What else was he teachin' ya?}}
{{dialogue|Andy|He said I was real good at math! But he can get kinda boring...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Math, science, literature, really.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Did he talk to you about the Free Cities at all?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Huh?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|I mean, did he teach you anything about the history of the Free Cities? Or about how the Free Cities operate...?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|No... he always said he should teach us about how the world works, that we need to learn for ourselves. I thought it was kind of silly, how am I supposed to learn myself if no one will teach me!?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So... He didn't say anything...?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|I tried asking about it! Honest! But he kept saying no...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Yeah! I kept tryin' to get it outta him, but he ain't budged.}}

*''That's interesting...''
*''SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES!''

{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=That's interesting...
|Huh... go figure...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES!
|Hahaha, I guess it's a possibility!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|What's sub-animal messages?}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Duh, it's like what Elsie does! Talkin' to animals an' junk.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Yeeeeah... let's go with that...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Ahem... well, I think we'd better get started anyway. We'll have a history lesson today, then...}}
