Title: Gunky Green Gorge Goo Gas Gone! Tunnel Talks Triumphant!
Once again, ''Player'' has led a successful dive into a new ruins! Well. Let's call them outdoor ruins? Eh, whatever the case, ''Player'' cleaned all the gunk out of the Valley of Whispers! Which has led to a sharp decline in incidents of what Sandrock doctors have labelled "Green-itis." It is expected that Green-itis will be soon completely eradicated.

Impressed with with our ability to greenify and also... de-greenify where need be, Musa has decided to pull the trigger on our road deal! This road to Portia will be one of the most important undertakings in recent Sandrock history, and it marks a turning point in our future as well. Yes, folks, there has never been a better time to believe in Sandrock than right now. Investors take note!

Musa has said that he does intend to stick around as we begin the project, which is nice. I mean. Isn't he the CEO of like five companies? Seems a little odd that he can just take a bunch of time off to watch us pass his little tests or whatever, but who am I to criticize?

(cId 1) A conversation 2092_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Heidi|Now that everyone's here, let's start the meeting. Mint and I have surveyed parts of the Eufaula Range and we've come up with a tweaked plan to present to everyone.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|This is a map of the Southern Eufaula between Sandrock and Portia. We're here, on the top right corner, and Portia is on the bottom left. In between, we have the two mountain ranges and the vast desert.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|For the Sandrock tunnel, we've selected the shortest route through the Eufaula Range to save money. It'll start here and end at this point.}}
{{dialogue|Mint|The only downside is that the rocks in this route are mostly metamorphic rock formations, so the drilling machine to be used for this-}}
{{dialogue|Musa|I changed my mind. I wanna use the {{textcolor|green|robot}}.}}
{{dialogue|Mint|Ah?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|The same robot that... nearly killed you?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|This guy convinced me.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|May I say, sir: you have excellent taste.}}
{{dialogue|Mint|Really? I thought we were going with the same concept as our Portia plan?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Wait, eh, sorry to interrupt, but... I'm sort of lost...}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''What robot? Give me all the details!''
*''Just tell me what to do.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=What robot? Give me all the details!
|Ahem. {{textcolor|green|The Mobile Suit}}.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Right, right. Before we get to the Director's robot there are a couple of things we'll need to be doing.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|First, there are {{textcolor|green|rocks}} beyond the bridge pass. Big rocks. {{textcolor|green|We'll need to smash 'em}}! I'd like the Builders help on this one.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Can do!}}
{{dialogue|Mint|indent=true|Once we're across, we'll need to build some {{textcolor|red|charges}} to {{textcolor|green|blow open an entrance point in the mountain}}. Um. Have you checked with the local Church of the Light about authorizing those?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Eh. Minister Matilda wasn't too worried about it when I broached the subject. Just don't tell Miguel, I guess... Now tell 'em about the {{textcolor|red|drill}}, Director!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Yes. My proposal is that, rather than using a slow-moving, tread-based drilling vehicle, I'll focus my time enhancing my- I mean, our city's Mobile Suit: fitting it with a {{textcolor|green|miniaturized drill}}, powered by the suit's R47 Power Core Ultra!}}
{{dialogue|Mint|indent=true|R47 Power Core Ultra?! That... should give the drill enough oomph to break up even the toughest rock. Now I see why Mr. Musa listened to you, it's a brilliant plan...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Cheers, Sleepyhead!}}
{{dialogue|Mint|indent=true|Just calling it how I see it.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Moving on, if my calculations are correct, and they are, the majority of digging and excavation could be performed by a single driver, piloting the {{textcolor|green|enhanced Mobile Suit}}...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Who will be that lone driver? I'm sure we can devise a very fair and unbiased method of selection... Might I suggest-}}
{{dialogue|Musa|indent=true|Let's cross that bridge when we come to it...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Hmm, if the Mobile Suit could really handle that much work, then I will use most of the budget on sturdier structural frames...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|As soon as the tunneling begins, my team will {{textcolor|green|set up the frames}} behind the suit to make sure the tunnel doesn't collapse.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|We'll need the Builders' help on this as well. I'll get you the {{textcolor|green|Structural Frame diagrams}} when we're ready.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|And soon... before you know it, we'll have a tunnel and a road; eight whole leagues through solid rock, straight into the Southern Eufaula Desert!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|After the tunnel is done, I think we'll need to construct a {{textcolor|green|Paving Block Machine}} to help us make the pavement for the road, but I think we can talk about this later.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|From there... Guess we'll just have to see who gets through to the middle first, us or Portia!}}
{{dialogue|Musa|indent=true|Well. No one can say you all came unprepared.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|indent=true|Mint, you work with Director Qi on his enhancement designs; keep me updated. Send the diagram to ''Player'' when it's ready.}}
{{dialogue|Mint|indent=true|Got it.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|indent=true|Trudy, are we in agreement?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Some of this is a bit over my head, but... As Mayor, sometimes all you can do is trust your experts. I'm in!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|answer=Just tell me what to do.
|Sure, sure. Don't mean to bore you with so many details! Hah! Get it... 'cause boring is like the same thing as... drilling... Right! Okay, I'll cut straight to the chase...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Okay! So to summarize... we'll need to...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|First smash the rocks leading to the mountain.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Then build the charges we'll use to blast the entrance of the tunnel.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|And don't forget my Mobile Suit drill!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Right... When you've finalized the diagram, we'll {{textcolor|green|upgrade the Mobile Suit}} to dig the tunnel.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|I think we can call it here, then. I have already submitted a budget to Trudy, so we can get started.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Alright! Everyone: to the Road to Portia!}}
