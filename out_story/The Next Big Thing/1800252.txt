(cId 1) A conversation 2421_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah! ''Player'', what wonderful timing! I was just coming to find you.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|You know, I've been wracking my brain, trying to figure out what I should do. Since Musa's gone, it's not like I'm desperate for investment but...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|What he said really stuck with me. Like... could I really have been that stupid?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|So I took a step back, and really reflected on what Musa told me. There aren't many tourists here. That's the sad reality, and is holding us back. Then I looked at my accounts, and actually my main income is from the locals.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|But it's not as if Sandrock is a wealthy town, I'm not going to be able to develop relying solely on business from Sandrockers.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Then it struck me, if tourists aren't coming here to buy things, how about if we sell it to them directly? Send our goods to other towns!}}

*''Where do you want to sell your goods?''
*''What do you want to sell?''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Where do you want to sell your goods?
|Hmm, we'll need to try and sell to places where they have the money and a need for something only I can provide. Highwind and Atara are the obvious choices. Maybe Walnut Groove as well.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=What do you want to sell?
|You know I thought about it a lot... it's kind of hard to sell regional specific goods due to different tastes and lifestyles. You'll need a lot of startup capital just to make a dent...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|So I thought, you know, what do we have? My sister's pottery is perfect. She's incredibly talented.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|There are two main issues I see now, though. We need to develop my sister's skills even further. Pottery takes a long time to make, but on the other hand... we need to be able to increase production if we want to export.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Packaging is also a problem. Her work is delicate, and the journey across the Free Cities is... not so delicate.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|So... I'd like to ask for your expertise. In all your research, have you come across any machine that could ease the burden and expedite the process for making ceramics? Or anything that can protect packages being sent out?}}

*''Have you checked any documents?''
*''Sorry, it's not really my area...''
*''Wow, you've really taken this seriously.''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Have you checked any documents?
|Hm... maybe you're right...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Sorry, it's not really my area...
|Ah, of course! I suppose a Builder is largely concerned with what's around them... logistics isn't really your area...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Wow, you've really taken this seriously.
|Well, you know you can't be stuck in the same place forever. My sister has suffered in silence for too long, I really need to get my act together.}}
{{dialogue||indent=true|(What should I say?)}}

:*''Have you checked any documents?''
:*''Sorry, it's not really my area...''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|answer=Have you checked any documents?
|Hm... maybe you're right...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=double|answer=Sorry, it's not really my area...
|Ah, of course! I suppose a Builder is largely concerned with what's around them... logistics isn't really your area...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah... I guess there's a lot more to learn...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Wait! The library in the City Hall! They must have something there! Would you mind coming with me? I'd appreciate having a professional eye on my side. Ah... if you don't have time, I'm happy to go alone.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Well, if you want to come, I'll be in the City Hall tomorrow! See you then... hopefully!}}
