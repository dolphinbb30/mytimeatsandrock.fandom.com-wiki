{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Bumble Ants are rising up.
|An interesting prospect... perhaps they're not actually the dumbest creature in the desert by far... but in fact, a hyper intelligent race of mutants. Breeding, multiplying, biding their honey and time as they wait for the perfect moment to strike...}}

{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Ranch family are aliens.
|Aliens...? So... they do exist! I knew it!}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|That explains the so called man with the powers of hypnosis... but the rest of them...?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|And how does Logan fit into all this?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|indent=true|answer=Owen and Logan are the same person.
|Indeed, no one has ever seen the two of them in the same room? In fact the same could be say about a lot of citizens! Almost anyone here could be Logan in disguise...}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Well done, ''Player''. I will investigate your claims further. Let us rendezvous at a more pertinent point in time...}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Huzzah!}}
