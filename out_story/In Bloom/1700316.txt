{{dialogue|Nia|Hey, sweetie! I brought some new seeds... want to plant them together? I think it'd be super fun!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Can we do it in your workshop?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|This is a special flower type... the seeds came from a prototype that sprouted using the soil from the terrarium you made me! That's why it looks so perky! Don't worry, it still has its roots and soil, we just need to plant it!}}

*''Of course! Let's do it!''
*''What's so special about this flower?''
*''Sorry, I'm kinda juggling many plates right now...''

|Alright, alright, I know you're busy! Well, come find me if you change your mind!}}
