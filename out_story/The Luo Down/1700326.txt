{{dialogue|Trudy|Welcome everyone, and thank you for coming! I've called you all here to discuss how we'll move forward with Operation Greenland, which is what we're calling it now, it's much catchier than the "plan to plant trees." Anyway...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We have wonderful guests visiting us all the way from Highwind who will be aiding us on this plan! Please say hello to Professor Luo and his assistant Nia!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Professor Luo is a leading botany researcher in the Free Cities, you may know him for developing the Planter Box technique. The professor and his assistant will be staying with us for a while to study and solve the soil issue we're facing in the Outback.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Thank you for the kind words, Mayor Trudy. I hope that we can work together to discover the reasons behind the inhospitable top soil. I'm also interested in studying the declines in biomass productivity, particularly those due to anthroprogenic causes.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Oh no, I'm getting ahead of myself... Uh, it's a pleasure to be here, I hope we have lots of interesting academic discussions and discoveries! Nia, do you want to say something?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Sure! It's so lovely to be back in Sandrock! A few of you have met me already, particularly ''Player''! It's great to see you again!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|It's good to see you too, Nia!}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''You're that guy from yesterday!''
*''Nia! You're back!''
*''(Stay silent)'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Professor Luo|indent=true|answer=You're that guy from yesterday!
|Ahh yes, I was poking around your workshop yesterday, wasn't I? If it weren't for you, I think I would have climbed to the peak of Mount Rocksand looking at plant samples before getting down to business, haha!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Nia! You're back!
|reward={{NPC2|Nia|rp=5}}|Hehe, did you miss me? I can't wait to see everyone again, I've been itching to come back to Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Now that we've become acquainted, let's continue, shall we?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|So let's assess the situation. We have now conducted two reforestation experiments in the desert.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|The Little Woods near Gecko Station was a resounding success. Using algae obtained from the Shipwreck Ruins, we were able to create a sustainable top soil that supported trees.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|The second attempt was to plant a larger forest in the Eufaula Outback. This time the results were... less than satisfactory. The algae did not prove effective, and the per capita water consumption was much higher than anticipated.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Any... ideas?}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|I visited Zeke yesterday and he gave me a thorough assessment of the situation. His research was fascinating. Desert planting is a colossal task, it is remarkable you have been able to achieve what you have so far.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Regarding the algae, we'll first collect some samples from the Outback. Then we'll compare and contrast the samples with those in controlled environments back in Highwind to see if we can observe any differences.}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|As for the water, I'm afraid I can't think of a solution right now... Based on Zeke's numbers, there will be a massive shortfall even if we somehow reduce the trees' per capita water intake.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, we had water shortages before and we pushed through, if we just put our heads together and-}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Wait, there will be another water shortage in Sandrock?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Director Qi? I didn't say that...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh, that's good, because that would be adverse to my tea drinking habits. If we're ever low on water again, why don't we just use the water from the Starship Ruins?}}
{{dialogue|0|...!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Wait, wait, wait, what? There's water in the northern ruins!?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Isn't this... obvious?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Uh...?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Sigh, ok, look, the Starship Ruins was a manufacturing and launch facility for aerospace vehicles, so of course there is water. Space flight takes a lot of water. They most likely even had an Atmospheric Water Generator.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I simply haven't found the reservoir yet. I thought Justice would have told you that by now...}}
{{dialogue|0|Huh!?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I- what?! You didn't tell me anything, either!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh, I thought it was just logical. I presumed that you understood this. My mistake.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|You... me, let's have a talk later!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Is this really true? There might be a reservoir in the Starship Ruins? And they have a water maker?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|No.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ah... s-so it was a joke-}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Not "might," I'm 100% certain there is a water reservoir in that area. It might have a Atmospheric Water Generator. They were built into every space facility during the late Old World period.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|...!}}
{{dialogue|Professor Luo|Well, it seems to me that the water issue might no longer be an issue, haha! Certainly worth this little misunderstanding.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Justice, can we get the Civil Corps out there to find this Atmospheric Water Maker?}}

If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|The professor coming to help us has given a lot of people hope. If an expert thinks it's worthwhile to come here... well... We'll see.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Met the professor feller. Bit stodgy, but alright. Easier to talk to than our science guy. Say... you don't reckon it's possible... Every science guy is probably pretty okay compared to Qi?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|So Qi was missing? And no one noticed? How about this: I'll be the bellwether. If he doesn't come in for his weekly tea supply, I'll inform everyone that he must be lost! ...And has been for anywhere from one to six days...!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Qi knew there was a huge supply of water in the northern ruins, and he just now thought to mention it? Something about that... doesn't sit right with me... I mean, I know we're not besties or anything but I'm preeetty sure I've made it clear to him that I'm a pretty big fan...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Hm... you can never go wrong calling in an expert, huh? And these people all have addresses; I should start sending letters to big shots like Luo, maybe get a bit of correspondence going...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Sure, that professor feller's been vetted by the Civil Corps, has a distinguished career that dates back decades, and as such, his whereabouts can be accounted for across said decades down to the hour... But who's to say he's not a Duvos spy!? That's right, y'all thought I forgot! Heck naw, I've been on my toes ever since! And I advise you do the same, ''Player''... Anybody could be a spy...!}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Professor Luo is super famous in the planting community! He even helped design the brochures we give out at the Temple. Ooooh... I could go get one autographed, couldn't I...!?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Y'all are takin' Qi back up to the Starship Ruins... Eh... You got it covered right? I'm more into critters than computers. Unless... that is... you need back up?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Huh? So the tunnel we worked so hard for didn't give us the water we needed, and it turned out there was plenty of water just up north the whole time? Well, that's how you know it's not a narrative and this is the real world! Although, we didn't notice it existed until it was incredibly convenient...}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Luo knows properties of many herbs... I'll try them in my own medicines.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I love Professor Luo. It's so nice to speak to a scientist who actually seems to have the concerns of his fellow man in mind. Can we keep him?}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Eh... do you know anything about the planting community? I'm kinda smiling and nodding through a lot of these interactions; what, er, what did Professor Luo do, exactly, that makes him so famous? Uh huh? Yeah? Ooh, that is pretty cool...}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|I think we can all learn something from Trudy's leadership; when you don't know the way forward, you ask the experts. I'm confident Zeke and Professor Luo will be able to figure out what the problem is.}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I wanted to have Professor Luo come talk to the kids, but... I'm afraid everything he's have to say is a bit too far over their heads. Nevertheless, it's always fun to meet an academic bigwig!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Professor. That's quite a title. Let me try it on. "Professor Jasmine, someone's let all the experimental bioweapons out of their testing cells!" Hm. Nope! Thiiink I'm good on that one...}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Had a chat with professor Luo, turns out he collects trains, too! I got him in on the newsletter, he didn't even know we had one. A great addition to the train enthusiast community of the Free Cities!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Went ahead and did a little background check on ol' Professor Luo. Turns out...! He's completely legit, absolutely zero chance that he's been anything other than a plant nerd over at that botany school his entire life.}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|I can recall a time here when half the guys who would hop off the train were just here to look at us like we were a circus sideshow... Now we got...  business owners, professors... all kinds out here pushin' us along...}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Hm... so we must learn more about planting in order to defeat the desert. Knowledge indeed can be the greatest weapon in one's arsenal...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Headed back up to them ruins, huh? I've had about enough of that place for a lifetime. You'll be alright. Watch ol' Justice's back, y'hear?}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|I can't seem to get the rest of the family interested in this Luo fella's accomplishments. We're more of the animal husbandry type, but... it seems like such a great opportunity, I'll be looking to sit in on any lectures he might grace us with.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Luo and Zeke are getting along great! You love to see it. A real meeting of the minds! I've also met your friend, Nia! She's cool, we should all hang out sometime!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|You've attracted experts to help with your efforts? I'll admit, I never would've expected something like this... I thought everyone would give up sooner...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Your friend, Ms. Nia, is a real kind soul. She went out of her way to greet me last time she was here. Let me know if there's anything I can do for the two of you.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|I definitely did a double-take when I saw your new boss. Thought maybe... that weirdo Yan had broken out and come back for revenge! Justice had to explain to me the situation... quite the story!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Did anybody notice that Qi had been gone for... however many days? I certainly didn't. Kind of a dangerous combination to be an explorer who never checks in with anybody regularly, huh? Let's get him to at least leave a note...}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|I got excited, having new people coming to town, but I've talked to the professor and... we don't have much in common. How's your friend Nia? Will you convince her to let me do her hair...?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Professor Luo's findings pop up in scientific literature from time to time. Given the chance, I'd love to pick his brain.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Dang. I gotta work harder if I want a leading wood expert to come to Sandrock. Although... I can't really think of who that would be. The thing about wood is, it's kinda, like... wood.}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Man, lotta big shots coming to Sandrock these days... I thought Musa would be the beginning and end of it, but, nah... now we got this professor guy, too! Maybe they'll hold one of them world summit things here sometime...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Apparently, Luo's boss was iffy on allowing the professor to come and help out, it was your friend Nia who sealed the deal. Look at you, ''Player''! Friends in high places, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I got excited when I saw Professor Luo checking the ground with a magnifying glass... turned out he was just looking at some weak sauce daisy.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|''Player'', your friend works with Professor Luo? That's amazing! I'd love to do something like that. Maybe if I had a degree, I could aim for a better life... like assistant manager!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|It's so lovely see you reunited with your old friend! How's it going? Pick right up where you left off? Or maybe need a little time to get there again...?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Slow day for the Commerce Guild, everything's on hold with planting til the research is done. They've got you going up into the ruins again? I see... Well, be careful. And... really think about whether this whole "two jobs" thing is good for your health or not...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Luo is filling in a lot of gaps in knowledge that tend to arise when you've been working solo all these years. He can be a little harsh, but I think Mi-an and Nia soften him up whenever we need it.}}
