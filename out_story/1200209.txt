{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|So as soon as you show up in town, this Logan character begins his crime spree. Seems a bit suspicious, wouldn't you say?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Er, I'm afraid you may be mistaken, sir. I came here roughly in the middle of the, "crime spree." And I didn't even know Logan existed before I came here.}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Likely story, likely story... Say! You're not one of those writers who does crimes and then writes about their own crimes as if they were fictional are you?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|What!? Is that even a thing?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Oh, brother. "Is that even a thing." 'Course it's a thing! What, you think I'd just make up some random accusation on the spot based on nothing whatsoever? I've busted at least three perps that fit that description...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Really? Wow, I must admit, that sounds quite interesting. Were they criminal masterminds?}}
{{dialogue|Bronco the Kid|Ah, well... you know... probably two of them were. That last guy though, criminal honor student at best.}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Amazing! Can you tell me more? Tell me all about the most interesting criminals you've tracked down, please!}}
The conversation ends.
