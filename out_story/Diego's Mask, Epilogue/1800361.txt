{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey, ''Player'', you're here! I'm trying to convince Ernest to do a book signing! I'll set it all up, all he has to do is sit there and sign books! It's easy money!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|It's a win-win! Hey, and the customers can resell for a profit! Win-win-win! And we need pens to sign with, so the pen makers will love it too! Win-win-win-win! How can you say no to that!?}}

{{dialogue|Arvio|But... alright... let's go with that.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I mean, sure we could just sell the books like normal, but this is a golden opportunity! It's not like it's price gouging... more, opportunism!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Arvio, I understand your point, but unless we do it my way, we're not going to do it at all.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah... fine, fine, I accept!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|It's settled! In two days we'll have the event! ''Player'', could you make me some posters?}}
