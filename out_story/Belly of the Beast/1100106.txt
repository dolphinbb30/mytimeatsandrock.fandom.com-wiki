If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|We were all very worried about you when we heard that you and Justice fell into the Gecko Station. It's not your job to put yourself in danger as a Builder; don't let those Civil Corps fellows push you around.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|So the Gecko Station was once an Old World train station or something, right? Find anything good there you'd be willing to sell? I'll bet tourists would love junk like that as souvenirs!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I would never take pleasure in seeing another creature suffer! However...! Being that the Geeglers were always bullying me and throwing trash at me, a lesser man might say something along the lines of "Nyeh nyeh, serves you right!" ...Not me, though. I would never say something like that.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Those Geeglers took parts off that bridge and then tried to drive a two thousand ton train across it. Brilliant, just brilliant. I wish my business rivals had the same acumen from time to time.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Fine work you done out there pardner, now the Gecko Station belongs to its rightful owners, the human race! My only regret is that I couldn't be there personally to see you administer heapin' helpings of grade A pain on their sorry be-hinds! Yeehaw!}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Good job, ''Player''! When I heard you were in there, I grabbed my shovel and tried getting into the canyon to help, but I couldn't find a way in. Next time, eh!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Dang, you fought off a bunch of Geeglers and even took on the big boss? You're way cooler than I thought!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|I heard that the Geegler leader fell off the bridge, is that right? Well, the villain has fallen, presumably the next act is a reprieve from danger.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Hey ''Player'', I heard you really held your own in the Gecko Station, that's great! Say, where did you learn to fight like that, anyway? You've got kind of an odd skillset for a Builder, huh? ...In any case, glad to have you on our side!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So thaaaat's what they were doing with all the parts they were scavenging... Seems like they ought to've found parts, I don't know, literally anywhere else? But what do I know? World domination has never really been my forte.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Gonna be a tough road ahead; no doubt that bridge is gonna need fixin'. Keep that hammer arm strong, Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Why did the Geeglers wanna hurt us? And why was their plan so bad? Are they... stupid?}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|So the Geeglers were building some kind of weaponized train to attack Sandrock with? Why that's... what an abominable use of train technology!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|So there we were... outnumbered a million to one, and I says to the Builder: "You think we got a shot makin' it out of here alive?" Builder says to me: "I like our chances better than I like theirs." What? Half the point of doin' heroic stuff is tellin' an aggrandized version of the tale!}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|Them Geeglers shoulda been cleaned up a long time ago! Hey Builda, I heard you were wicked brave in that lair. How's about you come tell our Pebbles all about it?}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Now why would those cute lizard folk want to destroy our home? Maybe that big ole Geegler got what was comin' to him fallin' into the canyon like that, he did. There, I said it!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|You can tell that the Geegler leader used fear to control his subordinates; as soon as his plans fell apart, not one of those little fellas went down to try to help him. Let's not be like them.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|It's really lucky for you that the side of the Gecko Station building was breakable. Like, really, really lucky! If it'd been all metal like some buldings, we'd be looking for you at the bottom of the canyon by now. Er, maybe best not to think about it!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|You really have proved your resourcefulness, Builder. It's unfortunate that you found yourself on the front lines of this recent conflict, but it's good to know we can depend on you to act under pressure.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|The Geeglers always had a strange organization for as long as we knew of their existence. Their leader always called himself the "president." Strange.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Wow, so the Geeglers were building some kind of armored battle train? That's wild... They must be a lot smarter than your run-of-the-mill sand mutants, huh?}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|Quite a feat you and Justice performed! I was never worried. I was always safe inside my barber shop. The Geeglers don't have any hair, darling!}}
{{dialogue|Pen|It's actually kind of a pity that lizard train didn't make it across the bridge. Think I can suplex a train? Well, now the world will never know...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|You probably know that tensile strength of cables can be calculated by dividing the breaking strength of the material by the cross-sectional area? The tram cable was made of steel, roughly 2.5 centimeters in diameter, so the safe load would be over 3000 kilograms. But taking into consideration structural fatigue and the sheriff's recent dietary decisions, I would have checked the cable before going across. It's elementary, my dear ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Looks like those Geeglers are gone now. That's lucky, Dan-dan kept going to the canyon everyday with a shovel, tryin' to "get at 'em." I'm kinda glad it's over and she can just stay home with me now, seriously.}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|You fought the Geegler leader by yourself and you're still walkin'? Woah, what's your workout routine?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Sorry you and Justice had to do all the fighting without me. We tried to find a way to you quickly, but we were still too late...}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|What goes around comes around! If you go around bullyin' and harmin' folk, it's only a matter of time before you end up at the bottom of a canyon. Ha!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|You did good in Gecko Station, so I've heard, but don't let it get to your head. Your place is in the workshop! Don't start getting crazy ideas, don't try to be a hero, y'hear?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Hearin' about the Geegler leader gettin' hoisted by his own petard like that... I'm sure there's a lesson to be learned in there somewhere.}}
