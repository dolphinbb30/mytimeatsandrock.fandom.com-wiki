{{dialogue|Venti|Hey! Your Crane Lift is amazing! When I stand on it, it doesn't sway at all, it's just like standing on flat ground.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|My name is Venti and I work at the salvaging company; I guess you could say it's my home, too! ''Player'', the moment I saw you, I felt a sense of familiarity. Let's be good friends!}}

*''Sure!''
*''We don't really know each other yet...''
*''Maybe not.''

{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|answer=We don't really know each other yet...
|Then we can get to know each other better. With good friends, there's nothing to fear in this world.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|I used to have a close friend named Grande back in my hometown, and we lived in the same dumpster. It was both economical and lively, and we weren't afraid of any monsters attacking us!}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|Oh, I have a great idea.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|answer=Maybe not.
|That's alright, everyone has their own preferences. Whether or not we become friends later is up to fate.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|I'll get back to work then, see you!}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Since we're already good friends, I must give you special treatment! For example, next time you come to dig for scrap in our salvaging company's scrap yard, there won't be any charge!}}

*''Wow, thank you!''
*''Does your boss know about this?''
*''I'm too embarrassed to accept...''

{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|answer=Wow, thank you!
|Hehe, well, if you want to dig for scrap next time and didn't buy a pass, just come find me. I'll take you in. Just don't tell the other Builders.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|answer=Does your boss know about this?
|Don't worry, our boss Rocky also admires you. He'll definitely agree.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|So it's settled. If you want to dig for scrap next time without a pass, come find me. I'll take you in. Just don't tell the other Builders.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|answer=I'm too embarrassed to accept...
|Please don't feel embarrassed; good friends walk through life together! As long as I, Venti, have something to eat, you won't go without!}}
{{dialogue|Venti|indent=true|So it's settled. If you want to dig for scrap next time without a pass, come find me. I'll take you in. Just don't tell the other Builders.}}
