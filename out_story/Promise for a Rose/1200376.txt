{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|answer=I'll be rich, even more than Musa.
|Why do you want to compare yourself to Musa? Do you think life is just a race to be rich? You need to be your own person. Being the best Builder, that's something Musa could never do.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|answer=I want to be become a powerful person, and protect you.
|I want to be stronger, I don't want to rely on others to protect me. I want to focus on my future, and what is right ahead of me. Why don't you focus on your career?}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|answer=Having no plan, that's the best plan.
|Your life philosophy, it's really special... but being without a plan might make you falter. Why don't you focus on your career?}}
