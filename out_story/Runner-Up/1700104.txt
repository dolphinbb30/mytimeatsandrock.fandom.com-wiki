{{dialogue|Arvio|Hey Builder! Out shopping again? How serendipitous! Unfortunately right now I have such a backlog I just can't make time to help you.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|If only I could split myself into thirds! One to watch the shop, one to deliver packages, then the last could go to the Game Center and just have fun all day. But alas, just this delivery alone might take all three parts...}}

*''Do you need some help?''
*''Well, good luck with that...''

|That would be greatly appreciated!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|It's a simple delivery, you just need to help me run this over to the customer!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|You see, this is a special condiment ordered by Owen for the Blue Moon Saloon, expertly made in Walnut Groove. Legend goes that with this seasoning, even a rock can be made into a delicious meal!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|The Blue Moon Saloon is one of By the Stairs most cherished customers. Though still, I do hope Grace doesn't let it go to waste. I'm a little worried about that...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|reward={{i2|Arvio's Goods|1}}|My store guarantees delivery within 24 hours upon supply arrival in town, so please don't forget! When you've delivered it, I kindly ask that you return to me and let me know. Thank you!}}
