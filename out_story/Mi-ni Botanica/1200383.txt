*''What kind of help?'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Nia|Well, you know how I've been helping out at the Moisture Farm. But with the greenification of Sandrock almost complete, I'm going to have more free time.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|So, I was thinking... maybe it's time for me to start something of my own! I want to settle down in Sandrock, just like you have.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|But I'm still not sure what that "something" should be.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Mi-an told me to follow my dreams and do what my heart desires.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|You know, I've always had a passion for tending to various plants in the gardens since I was a kid.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|So...}}

*''Open your own business, like Arvio and Amirah?''
*''Breed some rare varieties of plants for sale?''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Open your own business, like Arvio and Amirah?
|A business, huh? Like a shop, perhaps? But what should I sell? Potted plants? Gardening tools?}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=Breed some rare varieties of plants for sale?
|That's an interesting idea, but it might take time...Oooooh I could open a shop! But what would I sell? Gardening tools?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|That's perfect! And you could also sell flowers!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|You know, I've always wanted to be a shop owner too. When I was a kid, I used to dream of opening a bakery or a florist shop. Funny how life turned out - I became a Builder like the rest of my family.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|While I may not be skilled at growing plants, I love having them to decorate my house. I'm sure there are more people like me in Sandrock, and we don't have a store catering to that yet!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|So, I think that's a brilliant idea!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|I see! Selling flowers makes sense. It's easier than dealing with just gardening tools, which I have to import and find storage space for. But with flowers, I can grow them myself! Perhaps Zeke would even let me use a plot in his Moisture Farm.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|But how I can afford to rent a shop? I know I could ask my family for support as a last resort, but I'd prefer to figure it out on my own...}}

{{dialogue|Rocky|Starting a business ain't easy, so I often swing by that flower shop after work to get some flowers for my wife, if they have any left. Flowers make her happy, and our house smells good too!}}

{{dialogue|Vivi|Mi-an and Nia are now offering delivery services for me because they said I'm one of "the shop's most loyal members!" Those girls are very thoughtful.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Nia and Mi-an came to me to rent a plot in the Moisture Farm for their flower business. Uh, I wanted to give them the plot for free for all the help they've been, but they insisted on paying. Anyway, I'm very happy for them! It's a big deal to have their own shop.}}
