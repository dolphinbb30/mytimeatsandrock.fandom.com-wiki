{{dialogue|Vivi|Commissioner! What's all this commotion? Why are you harassing this innocent child here?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|It's "President," Ma'am. And this "innocent child" is in fact a devious criminal, have you forgotten? He bamboozled our whole town and made a tomfoolery of our rule of law!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|More importantly, he commissioned a very expensive shield from me that he has yet to pay for. You promised me vast riches, boy! I demand my vast riches!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|You fell for it cuz you're dumb. I scammed you fair and square! Shield's mine now!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Such dishonesty! Oh, how I loathe such behavior... Indeed, there's nothing worse than one who tells lies...}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Oh, stuff it, Commissioner. Yes he was in the wrong, but he's just a kid! And he was all alone out in the desert, we need to give him a good Sandrock welcome! Let him have his toy!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Yeah, welcome me, Sloppy Mustache!}}

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|If you want to give out shields left and right over at... eh... Dinkerton or whatever you call yourself, that's all well and good, but here at The Producer, we believe in a little thing I like to call, "integrity!"}}

{{dialogue|Yan|indent=true|Well, you yokels can redefine morality all you like, so long as I get that check in the mail! Just don't come crawling back to me when this boy reverts to a life of crime. Or worse, becomes a crusty juggler... Ta!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Ah hah! There's my favorite Builder! Nice to finally have someone with a head on their shoulders in the conversation!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Aw, nuts, ''Player''... Why're you sidin' with this yellow belly?}}
{{dialogue|Yan|I'll have you know that my abnormally shaded abdomen is caused by a rare genetic metabolic defect and it's no laughing matter!}}
