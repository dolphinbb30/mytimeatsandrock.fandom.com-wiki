(cId 10) A conversation 464, 465, 788, 789, 869 starts:
{{dialogue|Matilda|That'll do it! If you ever want to change your Workshop name again, you can buy a {{textcolor|green|Rename Card}} from the City Hall store.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Congratulations, Builder! Your workshop is officially open for business in Sandrock! Whenever you're ready, you can start taking commissions from the Commission Board {{textcolor|green|inside the Commerce Guild}}.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Now, I'm not exactly known around these parts for my arithmetic, but I do reckon we can expect a lot from two Builders as opposed to just ole Mason by his lonesome! Work hard, then you'll have plenty of pocket money for yourself, too, don't you know?}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|Hm... I daresay this calls for a celebration! Normally we have {{textcolor|green|Fireside Meetings}} on Sunday nights but I reckon I'll just round everyone up tomorrow to proper welcome you new Builders; oh and you must come, it wouldn't be the same without you!}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|See you then, and congratulations again, Builder! May you bring telesis to Sandrock.}}
