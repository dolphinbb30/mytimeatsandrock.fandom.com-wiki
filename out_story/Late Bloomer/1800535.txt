{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hey dear, come on in!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Zeke and I were just talking about this flower bud I saw sticking out of a puddle!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|The rain seems to bringing in all sorts of new types of life around the edges of town...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|But this one really caught my eye as something special!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Special...?I dunno about that. Ma used to keep a few back when I was a kid, but ended up gettin' rid of 'em. Bit too thirsty for what they are.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|That being said... they are pretty. They bloom into a four petal flower, each a different color.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Wow! How is this my first time seeing one?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Well, uh... in addition to being thirsty, these buds tend to grow a bit too big; the weight of the flower strains the stem. It's generally just an unhealthy plant. They usually die out here before they bloom.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Like a failure... of evolution or somethin'... That's just me shooting from the hip though. Could be any number of things...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Oh, so it's endangered...!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|It might be... in another ten thousand years or so. Don't uh... don't clear your schedule out just yet.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|But it is rare, right!?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Rare... in a four-leaf clover sense. You don't see 'em much, but... they're around.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|So what you're saying is... it wouldn't really be a great use of our time and resources to try to help the Yimi Flower...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Well. I mean... look. Not everything we do here has to... save the town or whatever. If you like the plant, why don't you find it again and help it out.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|If that goes well, snag some seeds. Plant 'em wherever you like.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Yeah? Nothing more pressing you need help with?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Nah. You do plenty around here. Go have some fun.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|...What if it's an invasive species?!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Well, I reckon that'd be nigh impossible on the account of because-}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|...Because how could an invasive species be almost endangered!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Oh. Yeah. That. And it's still a local plant at the end of the day.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Right! That too...!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Relax...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Whew! Relax...!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|You said you wanted to work here cuz you enjoy planting, so...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Go... enjoy planting.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|A-alright...! Alright, I will!}}

If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Burgess|Yimi Park is lovely, you should be proud of yourselves! I of course, volunteered to add the location to my safety patrol. If anyone ever messes with your flowers, ooh, you better believe everyone and their mother'll know about it!}}
{{dialogue|-2|Your Yimi garden is so amazing! The colors, the smells... agh! You know, I tried to rescue one once... it totally died! You guys need to show me what you did!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Everyone in town is talking about your flower garden. It's a hit! Thanks for helping to beautify our city, with not just your garden, but also with your lovely selves!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Gotta admit, the garden you and Mi-an made looks great. Ma woulda been real impressed by you two. You all share the same kind of passion. Not, er, for the Yimi Flower specifically, but... you know, uh... the general state of... stuff.}}
