{{dialogue|Polly-anne|What an honor! We're here reporting; we run the "Sow What!?" horticulture column for the Windy Times. When we heard you had a Yimi garden, we had to just take the next train over!}}

{{dialogue|Linhua|indent=true|If you're too busy, we understand.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Ah...! No, no... It's fine! Haha... we'd be happy to answer a few questions, isn't that right, ''Player''?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|C'mon, ''Player'', your Ma loves to see you in the local paper...!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|We'll be quick, I promise!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|If you don't mind, I'd like to start with the basics: how did you overcome all the difficulties of caring for the Yimi flower? Its heavy drooping bud, its thirst, its persnickety temperment in soil...?}}

*''We're Builders! We made a little house for it.''
*''We took turns holding up the bud!''
*''Go on, tell them, Mi-an.''

{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|answer=We're Builders! We made a little house for it.
|Of course! What a lovely detail. So you quit your day jobs and now do horticulture full time?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Er, not exactly. This is just a hobby for us.}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|answer=We took turns holding up the bud!
|Ahaha...!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|Why, that's a good one! Say, you'd get along with my husband here, he's a real jokester, too! Isn't that right, honey?}}
{{dialogue|Linhua|indent=true|Ahem...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|Ahem indeed... Anyway! No doubt you used your Building skills to make an enclosure for the flower?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|That's right!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Go on, tell them, Mi-an.
|Oh. Um. Well, we're Builders! So... we just made a nice little enclosure for the flower to make sure it didn't droop! Among other things.}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|Fascinating!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I saw one of these flowers on a walk one day, and it really struck me as something special. So I got with my better half here, spoke with the local expert and... the results speak for themselves!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|So part of it was all happenstance, though if anyone else had found the flower, they'd have thought nothing of it... Hm...!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|Dearest: would you be a dear and take a photo of the lovely couple here?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hold on: you're a couple, too?}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|Indeed we are! It was forbidden love; my darling photographer and I leading double lives within the office... But I never had to worry about you saying anything, now did I, dear?}}
{{dialogue|Linhua|...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|I suppose we're alike in many regards aren't we, you little Commerce Guild turtledoves...!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hm... Maybe so...}}

*''...''
*''Maybe so.''
*''I'm not like him, I talk all the time!''

{{dialogue|Linhua|indent=true|answer=...
|...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|Mwahaha...! Keep an eye on your better half, Ms. Mi-an, or else someone like me might try to snatch them up! Love that strong silent type...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Er... yeah...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|answer=Maybe so.
|You really are two-of-a-kind!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|indent=true|answer=I'm not like him, I talk all the time!
|My apologies, ''Player''. I did not mean to offend!}}
{{dialogue|Linhua|indent=true|...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|In any case, we share a passion for nature, and as such, I think it's no coincidence we've all found the sweetness of true love...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|Which reminds me!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|Darling dearest, won't you share with them some of our sweets from the wedding?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Oh! You're newlyweds! Congratulations!}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|Yes! Hardly had time to change out of my wedding dress! When we heard we rushed right over! Billed it as a business trip...}}
{{dialogue|Polly-anne|I suppose you could say this is our honeymoon! And the Yimi flower certainly doesn't disappoint...!}}
{{dialogue|Linhua|May this small gesture bring you... even more luck in your own marriage.}}
