{{dialogue|Catori|Thanks for coming all the way out here everyone!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|I thought it would be better for me to tell you all in person that I have decided to proceed with the Catori World project!}}

*''Oh that's great!''
*''Catori, but what about your son?''
*''You sure you can pull it off?''

{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Oh that's great!
|Yeah, it wasn't an easy decision, but I think I have everything sorted out.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I had some long correspondences over the telegraph with my Ma and son, and we've decided to have Alo join me here in Sandrock. Now that Sandrock is on the up-up and there's a school, we thought it was for the best.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=Catori, but what about your son?
|About that, I had some long correspondences over the telegraph with my Ma and son, and we've decided to have Alo join me here in Sandrock. Now that Sandrock is on the up-up and there's a school, we thought it was for the best.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|answer=You sure you can pull it off?
|Yeah, it wasn't an easy decision, but I think I have everything sorted out.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|indent=true|I had some long correspondences over the telegraph with my Ma and son, and we've decided to have Alo join me here in Sandrock. Now that Sandrock is on the up-up and there's a school, we thought it was for the best.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Oh, that's great!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Yeah! My son was fully supportive of my dream as well! In fact, he's really proud of me for attempting it! That's why I've decided to proceed no matter the challenges.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I'm glad we're getting one more young citizen in Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So what's the plan? I've heard you talk about this "Catori World" before, but never in detail.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Right. Catori World... Before the Day of Calamity, the world used to have something called an amusement park. We've all seen the images and moving pictures, but... what if we actually bring it back. Right here in the Valley of Whispers?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|What if we include some of the rides that we can only imagine now? As well as the lights, the food, the glamour! Think of the result! People will come from afar, just to look at it in wonder!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|If we build it, they will come! I just know it! It'll be the happiest place in the Free Cities!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|That's... a grand vision! Filled with uncertainties... and pitfalls... and a lot of other adjectives that are synonymous with "difficult." But boy does it sound like something I'd want Sandrock to have!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Sounds real difficult to build though, or one of 'em bigger cities would've done it by now.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Yes, it will be high risk. That's why I've decided to leverage all of my current operations to get a loan for the land lease and the first couple of rides. If they prove successful, then I can get institutional investors like Musa to jump onboard.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Still, if City Hall or any other investor wants in, you're welcome to, but I'm forging ahead even if it's just me. That's my commitment.}}

*''I'm in.'' (No unique dialogue)
*''I'll decide later.'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Catori|Sure thing ''Player'', we can discuss more details later.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I'll want to see more details as well. Is there anything else you need City Hall to do?}}
{{dialogue|Catori|As a matter of fact, I do. While I'm getting my loan secured, I would like City Hall's help in making the Valley of Whispers a secure area. There are still dangerous creatures emerging from the ruins, it'd be great if we can... stop that. Somehow.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Ohhh... so that's why I'm here!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Do you think it can be done Sheriff?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah, sure. This has always been on my schedule, but the Civil Corps' been kinda busy with all the patrols lately, so we never got around to it. Ged told me before that all the creatures are comin' from one breach. So all we gotta do is plug it!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|How 'bout this, I'll gather a posse tomorrow and we'll clean it up in one go. I can count on you right, ''Player''?}}

*''For sure!''
*''Phew, my plate is getting real heavy...''
*''What about Elsie?''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Phew, my plate is getting real heavy...
|I know, I know, but we're gonna need a Builder for such an operations, so we need ya! ...Please?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=What about Elsie?
|Oh, uh, Elsie told me she tried to communicate with one of 'em mutated creatures before and she failed, so that's that.}}
{{dialogue|Player|indent=true|(What should I say?)}}

:*''For sure!''
:*''Phew, my plate is getting real heavy...''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=double|answer=Phew, my plate is getting real heavy...
|I know, I know, but we're gonna need a Builder for such an operations, so we need ya! ...Please?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|We'll stage our operation from this point. Come here tomorrow when you're ready to go, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Oh yeah, uh, bring that 'ole {{textcolor|green|Vacuum}} you used before, there still might be excess gas floating about... can never be too careful...}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Looks like you've got it under control, Sheriff. Thank you all for coming out today, I'm super excited to get this one started!}}
