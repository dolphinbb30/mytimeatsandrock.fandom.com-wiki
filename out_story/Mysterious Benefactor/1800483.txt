{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah, hello, ''Player''...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Sorry if I seem a bit bewildered... The most curious thing has happened...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|In order to get funds for my next big push for By the Stairs, I put out a public notice for investors... and I only got one...}}

*''Better than nothing.''
*''I guess no one likes you.''
*''What kind of investor?''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Better than nothing.
|Yeah, you could say that again...!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I guess no one likes you.
|Oh ho, you misunderstand; although I can see why your mind went there first!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|On the contrary, I can say for certain at least one person likes me very much! This investor...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=What kind of investor?
|Yes, that's what's got me all tied in knots... it's the most bizarre thing...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|...He sent me 20,000 Gols! With nothing but his signature. "Tony."}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|So, naturally, I write back immediately! I thank him for his support, ask if he'd like to meet, talk about how to spend the funding... and he said, "no...!"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I wrote another letter, "Is there anything, and I mean anything, you name it, anything you'd like me to do for you?"}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|And he said... "I'd like for you make some shoes for the pets of Sandrock."}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I asked why... and he never replied.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Another follow-up, no response.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|It's been weeks now, and... I don't know what to do.}}

*''Spending spree!''
*''Invest in yourself.''
*''If you feel guilty, just give it to me!''
*''Looks like we're making pet shoes.''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Spending spree!
|Haha... I'm trying to clean up my act, ''Player''! Remember?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Invest in yourself.
|Yes, I'm sure there will be plenty left over after I... Well. First things first.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=If you feel guilty, just give it to me!
|I don't feel guilty... And besides, I plan to give this money back to you and other members of our community in the form of affordable prices on day-to-day goods!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Looks like we're making pet shoes.
|reward={{NPC2|Arvio|rp=3}}|Yes! Yes...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I think one thing is clear. Tony only had one request, and as an upstanding, principled shop-owner, I believe I have no choice but to honor this request, no matter how bizarre!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|''Player'', will you help me fulfill this strange order? To make... shoes...? Shoes for the pets of Sandrock?}}

*''Sure, why not?''
*''No, I don't want the pets to wear shoes.''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Sure, why not?
|Yes! I do believe this is the right thing to do. Alright. I'll speak with Vivi about the details, and then have her forward her designs to you.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Let's do this!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=No, I don't want the pets to wear shoes.
|I see...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|There could be a case made for giving the dogs shoes, but cats... cats don't need shoes, do they? In fact, it ruins their sense of balance, I've heard.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Yes, there may be weight to your words... I think I'll put this idea on hold. If Tony is really upset, he can respond to my letters!}}
