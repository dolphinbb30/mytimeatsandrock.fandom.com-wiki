{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah, wonderful! I'll distribute these to the pets of Sandrock early tomorrow morning. Take a look around when you wake up!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|As it turned out, though, it wasn't exactly practical to make shoes for cats. Camels either for that matter...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|...Hm.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|''Player'', do you think it was right? For us to do something so incredibly pointless, for someone who will never even see that we did it, and even if they did, they probably wouldn't even care that much?}}

*''We did it because we have integrity.''
*''Wow... yeah, I guess this was a waste of time...''
*''I don't care as long as you pay me.''
*''I'm excited the pets will have shoes, too.''

{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=We did it because we have integrity.
|reward={{NPC2|Arvio|rp=2}}|Yeah... Yeah! You know what? You're right! Maybe it didn't mean much to this person, maybe for them, money grows on trees. But to me, it was important. And now I can accept his investment proudly, knowing that I've done the right thing.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=Wow... yeah, I guess this was a waste of time...
|Hm...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|Well, what's done is done. We shouldn't worry ourselves over it now.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I don't care as long as you pay me.
|Haha... I see... Yes, of course, I will pay you your usual rate.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|indent=true|answer=I'm excited the pets will have shoes, too.
|reward={{NPC2|Arvio|rp=2}}|Ah? Really? Haha! Well, now I feel more than justified in fulfilling Tony's strange request. If we made one person happy then that makes it all worthwhile, doesn't it?}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Alright, then, ''Player''. As I said, I'll try to get these shoes on the pets by tomorrow. And... who knows. Maybe Tony really will find out about this...}}
