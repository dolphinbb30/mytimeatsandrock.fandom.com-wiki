(cId 0) A conversation 2235_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Justice|Heyyy there, partner. Hate to bother you but uh... we're here by mayoral request, just doin' a little checkerooni... Nothin' serious.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|No doubt you recall Logan and his... questionably motivated, eh... temporary relocation of our Minister Matilda...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|What you may or may not recall, Matilda does now seem convinced, contrary to popular opinion, Logan may in fact not be crazy.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Or at the very least, she thinks it may be possible that someone in town is hiding water, like he asserted. Now, due to our water shortage, this topic comes up every now and then, but I don't know...}}

*''I agree. I think someone is hiding water.''
*''I doubt there's anyone hiding water.''
*''Wait, are you accusing me?''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=I agree. I think someone is hiding water.
|Eh? Really? Well, I guess you'll be glad to know that the Civil Corps has been asked to open a case. Hence, us being here.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=I doubt there's anyone hiding water.
|Yeah... me too, partner. I mean... we already looked around everywhere, talked to everybody... If someone's hidin' water out here, we'd know by now.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Wait, are you accusing me?
|Oh, shoot, no! Not at all, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|If there is someone hiding water, which, as I have established previously, is not likely to be the case, the chances of you being the person in question are basically zero...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|See, I'm guessin' Logan's motive with this is to sow discord, or maybe make people angry at the Church...? I dunno.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Oh, uh... I guess, now that I think of it, I do have a couple questions I do need to ask. Like I said, just a formality.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|First question. About how many {{textcolor|green|units of water}} do you usually go through in a given month?}}

*''A hundred or so.''
*''A thousand wouldn't be enough!''
*''I actually don't use much at all...''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=A hundred or so.
|Hm, that sounds about right. Pretty average for a Builder. Builders, blacksmiths, y'all are expected to go through a fair share as part of the trade.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=A thousand wouldn't be enough!
|Woah...! You serious?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|If that's the case... you use more water than anyone in town! Eh, well, I mean I heard Builders need a lot of water but... I dunno, can I ask you to tone it down a little if possible?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=I actually don't use much at all...
|Ah yeah? That's impressive considering all the stuff that comes out of this place. Keep it up!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|This one's less of a quiz, more of a survey. How well informed do you feel when it comes to the {{textcolor|green|water situation}} in Sandrock?}}

*''Not informed at all.''
*''I know there's not enough to go around...''
*''We import water, everything should be fine.''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Not informed at all.
|Right, right. Lot of people are out of the loop. Think that's how all these nasty rumors got started: "so-and-so's washin' their hands every ten minutes! They must be holdin' out on us!" And so on and so forth... Pretty sure that's how Logan got started down that rabbit hole of his...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=I know there's not enough to go around...
|Yeah... the oasis is lookin' worse by the day. We import water on the train, but we're really just puttin' a bandage on the problem...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=We import water, everything should be fine.
|Eh, maybe fine for now, but... It's not gonna work forever. And what happens if our source ever gets cut off?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Let's er, try to go out on a high note with this last question. Oh. Nope. Still kind of a bummer. "Do you or anyone you know suspect someone of {{textcolor|green|hiding water}} in Sandrock?"}}

*''I've never seen anything suspicious.''
*''Maybe it's Burgess.''
*''T'was I all along!''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Maybe it's Burgess.
|Eh, you're not crazy to suspect Burgess. He does get pretty maniacal about water.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|But nah, he's the first guy we looked into. He spends... almost literally all of his time looking for people commiting minor crimes and checking water usage himself. Plus, eh, let's just say he doesn't strike me as the criminal mastermind type.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=T'was I all along!
|Haha, c'mon, ''Player''. You're cleared already. Still, I'd be careful makin' jokes like that. Some people are still real sideways about the whole ordeal.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Alright. Well, that'll about do it on my end, ''Player''. Thanks for your patience. Let me know if you ever come up with any leads of your own.}}
