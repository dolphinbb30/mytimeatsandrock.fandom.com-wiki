{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah, Mr. Musa... before you go, could I trouble you to enlighten us: what exactly is the, "Northern Development Plan?"}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Is this really the time?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Answering your question would be the least of my troubles today. Sure, but I'll have to make it quick.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|It's no secret to anyone that tensions between Duvos and the Free Cities are rising again. Firefights have broken out over the ruins of Orzu in Ethea, which Duvos also "claims." We can hope for the best, but we need to prepare for the worst.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|The short of it is, the Northern Development Plan is an Alliance initiative; one meant to beef up our collective defenses in the north bordering the Orzu area, should there ever be hostilities with Duvos again.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|A war...? Do you honestly think it's going to come to that?}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Now, I don't mean to alarm anyone but...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Duvos and their ambitions are unambiguous. Many, including myself, believe that they wouldn't stop at Orzu, were Ethea to even concede that. I think their Emperor has made that perfectly clear... Still, we are much stronger than before...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Goodness! I thought the plan was just about jobs and stuff. Well. I suppose I'd take Sandrock over wartorn borderlands any day of the week!}}
{{dialogue|Musa|Don't get me wrong, it is about providing new opportunities for anyone willing to move there. It's just that there's also a strategic dimension to it. Most likely, once we strengthen the north, Duvos will leave us alone for good.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Ah... I see...}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Ahah... Yes. Well, thank you very much for answering Arvio's question, and providing such insight into the state of our Alliance...}}
{{dialogue|Musa|The people have a right to know. Shall we, then?}}
The conversation ends.
