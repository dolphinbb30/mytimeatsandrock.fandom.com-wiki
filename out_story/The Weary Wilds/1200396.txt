{{dialogue|Logan|Hm. I'm fine. Think that soup did the trick.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Tracked that sonovagun into a cave a league or so from town; real winding like. Had to leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find my way back, like one of them fairy tales.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Wish I'd had the presence of mind to camp'm out; as you know, a beast with his back against the wall can be... rather precarious.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Unfortunately for our foul-tempered friend, I'm worse. Here's the bounty; counted it up already. It's square.}}

|My daggers are plenty sharp, thank you very much. Put the money towards something for yourself, ''Pet Name''. I insist.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=I could use this for materials.
|Haha, you come all the way out here, but left your mind in that workshop of yours, huh? Well, I hope you know, ''Pet Name'', if you ever need anything of that sort, I'm happy to fetch it for you. Even if I have to borrow it off some critter still usin' it...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=Why don't you just spend it on yourself?
|Reckon I owe you one for cleanin' up this mess, if nothin' else.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Well, ''Pet Name'', would you look at that. Rain's let up. And just when I was startin' to think... we were in our own little world, just the two of us.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|What about you? What are you thinkin' now?}}

|Hey, you got it. I swear on my Pa... and everything he ever taught me: you've got nothing to worry about.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Hm... Reckon for better or worse, it's high time to leave our little world and head back to the other one. You go on ahead. I'll do the dishes. Only fair.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Oh, and don't worry. I'll hang my hat at home tonight.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=We should get out of here.
