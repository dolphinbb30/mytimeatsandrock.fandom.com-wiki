{{dialogue|Unsuur|Hi, you're the new Builder? I'm Unsuur. Second... or third in command at the Civil Corps, I'm not really sure. We keep the peace around here because if we didn't... things would be a lot less peaceful.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Sheriff told me I have to watch this door and make sure no crazy robots get out of the {{textcolor|green|Paradise Lost Hazardous Ruins}} here behind me.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Paradise Lost used to be a shopping mall in the Old World, but after the Day of Calamity, all the robots went crazy. Or was it before? I dunno, I was never good at history.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Oh. You wanna go in here? I thought you just wanted to chat with me... Well, the lock on this door here is broken, and Justice told me not to let anyone in or out until it's fixed. So... sorry.}}

*''I can fix it.''
*''I see.''

{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|answer=I can fix it.
|Yeah, probably. The door kinda looks fine to me. But I gotta follow orders; Sheriff Justice has to get an official commission through the City Hall: that's just how it is, I guess.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|So until Justice does the paperwork, I'm sorry to say I can't help you...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Yeah. Maybe you'll get a commission soon to fix it. But... who knows how long that could be? If I were you I'd just do other things for a while. I'm sure we'll re-open Paradise Lost when the time is right. I mean, probably.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Well, good luck. Hope you're enjoying Sandrock.}}
