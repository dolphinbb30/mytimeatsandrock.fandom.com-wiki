If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|So that mirror from the Old World you brought back... it allowed people then to change their appearance to whatever they could imagine? I wonder if that made them happy... or rather, endlessly unsatisfied?}}
{{dialogue|Andy|What? Logan's goat? Why do you want information of Rambo...? Er... I mean Randal...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Those seven moles you told me about could make for great action figures. Just have to get Amirah to churn out the same basic shape and we can paint them different colors for seven times the profit! Gotta collect them all!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Interesting, so there are mole people living around Sandrock? Hope they'll pop up one morning to say hi!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Hey, heard you and the Civil Corps are still chasing after Logan. Careful out there, ''Player''. But if you do ever find him, sock him one for me, will ya? Tell him, "This one is for Sandrunning!"}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|The goat is attracted to Roasted Rutabaga? The vegetable agent of chaos? By the Light, I swore I'd never allow such blasphemy into or around my household but... if it's for a good cause... I support y'all, ''Player''! For the greater good! Just keep it away from Elsie...}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|So we're just gonna rebuild that killer mirror? I don't even think you have to be down with the Church of the Light to know this is a really bad idea! How many times do we have to bring up the dancing robot from Ethea before they learn...?}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|Looks like Roasted Rutabaga is back on the menu boys! Woohoo! My favorite!}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Weird to think there are still kings and queens in this day and age. You'd think they'd be pure fantasy by now. Why do mutant animals have such a predisposition towards monarchy?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I took a look at that mirror AI, it's fascinating! People back in the Old World had all types of different AIs optimized to look after their daily needs. I'm surprised they didn't just rise up and kick out the humans.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|So the bounty hunter led you guys to another deadend, huh? Figures... you can't do anything nowadays on a shoestring budget!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Heard you ran into some Bandirats? Tough little mutants. I ran into 'em once in some ruin once when I was young. Had to give up my favorite hammer at the time to get outta there!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|I heard that mirror robot that you all found acts so weird! Who'd want someone like that doing your hair? I much prefer Mr. Pablo.}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|I heard from Unsuur that you guys got rid of some Bandirats, is that right? Never liked 'em Bandirats, always lookin' for stuff to steal off of my trains.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|We've got the info we need to track Logan down... I'd imagine things might get pretty serious pretty soon, so... whatever happens, just know I've got your back, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|Logan hasn't really done anything in forever, you all are still goin' after him? Ah, yeah. The crimes. What's the statute of limitations on blowing up a water tower?}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Cooper banned Roasted Rutabaga from our household after suspecting that it was the primary factor in imbuing our daughter with her tomboyish inclinations. Of course, I believe it to be superstition, but... take it from an old pro, in marriage, sometimes you have to just pick your battles...}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|What a strange creature, that Bandirat Queen. Mobilizing her whole kingdom to mosey out here just to harm her own step-daughter... They couldn't have found anyone more suited for leadership over there?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Seems like more often than not the missions we go on end up going way off the rails. How come it's never, "Hey guys, we need to find this algae. Oh, here it is. Nice! Let's go home!"}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Sigh, I heard from Pen... we really should've spend more on a higher quality bounty hunter...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Logan... may not have shown us mercy. But we must do our best to show it to him. Hearing your tale... made me think of him...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|They're putting Amirah in prison!? ...? Oh. "A mirror." Well. That's fine.}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|Hm... so I'm hearing there might be some new information on Logan. Justice wouldn't say anymore. Come on, tell me. ...No?}}
{{dialogue|Pen|I do sincerely apologize, Skinny. I should've fired that Bronco a long time ago... What? On whose authority? Do you really need to ask for authority to fire someone like that...?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The Civil Corps asked me if I wanted to take a look at the mirror AI. I was not interested. Hit me up when we're dealing with space robots.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Dan-dan's been super paranoid ever since you guys brought back that mirror robot. Personally, I think it's cool that robots did everything back in the day. Think of all the free time it allowed! So much room for activities...}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Man, heard you had some problems with Bandirats, shoulda called us boys over! We're pros in dealin' with 'em. Heck, we even chased off a Bandirat King a long time ago!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|So Justice told me about what happened with the mole and the top secret mission you have coming up. All I can say is: good luck.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|When that mole first told us what we were gonna have to do, I thought he wanted us to chase down the 'greatest of all time,' which was a bit worrying. Luckily it turned out to be just a regular goat. But shh... we're not supposed to tell anyone.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|You guys have been ramping up searches for Logan recently, huh? Well, if you ever find him, tell'em... his grandma misses him.}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Looks like you're doing some nice work out there with them little Civil Corps pals of yours. No doubt you're here to thank me for cultivating you into the jack-of-all-trades super soldier you are today! Well! I am honored, but give yourself some credit, too! You learned quick and really took my advice to heart! Unlike our other Builder...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|If you do ever end up squaring off with Logan again, tell him the lunch I made for him is still in my fridge. I didn't eat it, even after all this time. Cuz I'm not a bandit, like some people...}}
