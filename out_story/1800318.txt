{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hello everyone! Thank you for this opportunity! Recently, I have been working with Zeke on a plan to plant a forest in the Eufaula Outback that could block the sandstorms from Sandrock almost entirely!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|We've already demonstrated some success with the Little Woods near Gecko Station, but with Portian water, we'll be able to scale up substantially! But I'm not the expert here, so Zeke can explain everything in more detail!}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|...Uh...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Don't worry... just go over it like we rehearsed! You can do it!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Right... Sorry, just a little nervous; been a while... Ahem. The Eufaula Outback in the north is, uh... really big. It's got lots of land, and sand. If we plant trees there, they can stabilize the terrain and stop the runoffs...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Economy...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|This isn't some small project though, uh, it'll probably cost City Hall a lot of money... no sorry, didn't mean to say that.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Talk about how it'll help Sandrock!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Right, uh, if we use more water from Portia, we should be able to maintain a large enough forest in the Outback to lessen or even stop the sandstorms. We... uh, will finally get a sustainable Sandrock.}}

{{dialogue|Trudy|Do you have a more detailed plan? What do we need to do first?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Uh, well, I guess I want to do a test planting on the Outback sands first. The sand over there's drier, and the water table is much lower. For that we'll need a small Irrigation Tower in the area.}}

{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|answer=Will this work...?
|Well, uh, we can't rely on just planting trees in the long term. Our goal is to make a self-sustaining forest, big enough to change the environment around Sandrock in to something... better.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|This isn't uh... isn't about making Sandrock green again, it'll be much greener and more suitable for living than before.}}
