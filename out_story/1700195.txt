{{dialogue|Justice|Again with the bandana in the photo?}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Sorry, sir. I'm just not good at drawing the lower halves of people's faces. That and hands.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Man...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I only had the confidence to draw Andy because we just saw him. People seem to really care that these posters look good. Remember when you drew those wanted posters for the other City States in a hurry?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah, yeah, well... I mean, I also think we can agree people got a little carried away with the critiquing of my work.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Personally, I thought they were fine.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah. They were fine.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Oh, hey! ''Player''! What do you think of the new posters? Do you uh... think you could recognize one of these sonuvaguns from like... bridge of their nose up?}}

*''Yeah, good enough.''
*''I dunno...''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Yeah, good enough.
|reward={{NPC2|Unsuur|rp=3}}|reward={{NPC2|Justice|rp=2}}|Yeah! Right? I mean, they're always wearing the bandanas anyway, 'specially when they're perpetratin' criminal activities and the what not... so... maybe it's better to do it this way anyway.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|And the top parts of everyone's heads, well, they always look pro when you do it, pal.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|Thanks guys.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=I dunno...
|Ah, shucks...}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|I need to practice more.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Forget about it, pardner. You're the best we got. You just keep doin' you. One day, I'm sure you'll be sketchin' out the finest lower face halves seen this side of the Eufaula! Maybe even hands, too, if you stick with it.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|Should we commission Pablo to start doing the portraits?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Nah, nah... that guy always gets too artsy-fartsy with it. Can't recognize the crooks in his conceptions. They're even worse than yours.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|indent=true|Wow. Worse than mine. That means a lot, sir. Okay, Sheriff. I'll keep giving it my all.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|You take 'er easy, ''Player''. Watch out for bandits. Who may or may not be wearing bandanas!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|And in case they're not, er... just be ready to use your imagination I guess!}}
