{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hey, ''Player''! How's it going?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Medicine? Oh, thanks! How'd the commission go? Did Heidi like it?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Great! How nice of her. But even with medicine, Dr. Fang said, er-, implied I need to work half-days for the better part of a month. I'm already starting to stress.}}

*''Why work so much?''
*''Why stress?''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|I...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|I don't know? That's just how I am? Almost everyone in my family is a successful Builder, and... it's just assumed that if we're not doing something productive, we're wasting time.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Back when Elsie took my license, I mean, it was my fault for losing it and I was letting everyone down by not taking commissions! My parents would be so disappointed if they saw me loafing around, letting my workshop rating stagnate...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Now because I overworked myself, I'm going to get behind again! And it's even worse than last time! If I really spend half my time cooped up in my workshop for two weeks I think I'm gonna go crazy!}}

*''Why not try a new hobby?''
*''Find something to help you relax.''
*{{flirt}}''Maybe you should date someone.''

{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Why not try a new hobby?
|Ho... bby?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|A hobby!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Yeah! Now why didn't I think of that- Hobbies can be productive! You know, I've always kind of wanted to take up Zeke on his offer to do some greenhouse planting but never had the time. Good idea, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Find something to help you relax.
|Relax? ''Player'', that's what I'm saying: the only time I can relax is after I feel like I've done something productive!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Well, now that I think about it, Zeke gave us a bunch of seeds after that whole greenhouse ordeal... I wonder if learning to grow them could be useful? Yeah, that could work!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|answer=Maybe you should date someone.
|D-Date...?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Hahah! Yeah, right! Good one, ''Player''! I don't think anyone here likes me like that, anyway. I'm just here to focus on being a Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|indent=true|Oh, I got it! Zeke gave us those seeds after the Moisture Farm ordeal; I wonder if learning to grow them could be useful...? Yeah, that could work!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Thanks for all your help, ''Player''. Because of you, now I have medicine, no pending commissions, and a plan for my downtime! I feel better already!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Okay, you've spent enough time on me, you need to get back to doing stuff for yourself! Let's catch up again when I'm back to one hundred percent!}}
