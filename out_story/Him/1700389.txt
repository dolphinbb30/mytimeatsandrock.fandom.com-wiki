{{dialogue|Talon|...So this is who he chose... interesting.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|First, let me introduce myself. My name is Talon, hailing from Seesai. You may have heard of me. You are the Builder, ''Player'', is that correct?}}
{{dialogue|Talon|Good. Then let me make a long story short. Tomorrow, I will be returning home, with my son...}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Talon? Nope, never heard of you.''
*''Who is your son?''

{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=Talon? Nope, never heard of you.
|You haven't heard of me? Fang, he didn't mention me at all?}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|I am his father.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=Who is your son?
|Your husband, Fang.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|There is no commission. Forgive my deception. I wanted to tell you face to face when introducing myself as Fang's father. I was afraid you would not allow me to speak my piece.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|Long have I searched... and now, I've finally found him.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|Something that should've happened long ago... There have been some tribulations along the way. But no matter. The reason I called you here: I believe you have the right to know that he is leaving. Without you.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''What!? What should I do, then?''
*''He won't go with you!''

{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=He won't go with you!
|Oh, I think he will. I always get what I want. One way or another.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|If you would like to come to Seesai, I would not object-}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''No way!''
*''Take me with you!''

{{dialogue|Talon|â€”But you would no longer be his spouse. You will have nothing to do with him in the future.}}
The conversation ends.
{{dialogue|Talon|Fang's hand in marriage is far too valuable to be wasted on someone of your... strata.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|My son will have a bright future. He will not be a reclusive shrink in some lowly desert town. I will make up for the years he has been away. Give him the life he never had.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|I digress... These are family matters. None of your concern. Let's get back to the issue at hand. You!}}
{{dialogue|Talon|I'm not made of stone, ''Player''. I'll make you one offer and one offer only: if you are willing to leave him and be quiet about it, I will compensate you handsomely.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|Yes, with you quietly out of the picture, I will have no trouble bringing my boy home. He'll be heartbroken that you 've left so abruptly but... he'll get over it.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|So what about something to the tune of... 2,000,000 Gols. Would that suffice?}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''You think money can solve everything!?''
*''That is a lot...''
*''No. I don't need your money.''

{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=You think money can solve everything!?
|Mm. Money can solve most of life's problems. If Fang wants to continue practicing medicine as a hobby, then I will open a hospital for him in Seesai. Is this something you could provide?}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=That is a lot...
|Haha... enticed already, are we? This is going to be easier than I thought...}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=No. I don't need your money.
|Mm. Money can solve most of life's problems. If Fang wants to continue practicing medicine as a hobby, then I will open a hospital for him in Seesai. Is this something you could provide?}}
{{dialogue|Talon|Indeed. Speaking with you it is abundantly clear to me, now more than ever, Fang belongs in Seesai. His home.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|I regret only the timing... his stepmother has passed away, and his brother has suffered... an ill fate. If not for this, we could be whole again...}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''Whole again? What about Fang's mother?''
*''His stepmother was a terrible person!''

{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=Whole again? What about Fang's mother?
|Sarnai... Sarnai...}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|That is in the past. Only the weak dwell on that which they cannot change.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=His stepmother was a terrible person!
|What...!?}}
{{dialogue|Talon|You seem to hold some sort of grudge. Sigh... but how could I have thought you could possibly understand what is best for him? You are but a simple Builder, stuck in this decrepit, backwards town.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|...}}
{{dialogue|Talon|There is one last thing I require of you. Having been absent all these years... Hmph... perhaps in some ways... you know who he is now better than I.}}
{{dialogue|Talon|So, tell me. What reasons has he given for his behavior? Why does he insist on running from me, running from his destiny?}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I do?)}}

*''(Calmly tell the truth)'' (No unique dialogue)
*''(Scold him)'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Player|...}}
{{dialogue|Player|...}}
{{dialogue|Player|...}}
{{dialogue|Talon|Abuse? What are you saying? Covered in scars!? Impossible. How could they do this to him without my knowledge!?}}
{{dialogue|Talon|That... no, I didn't know...! That can't be true...}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''You ruined two families!''
*''(Remain silent)''

{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=You ruined two families!
|Sarnai... it was love at first sight. I've never loved someone as I did her... How could I have not seen...}}
{{dialogue|Talon|indent=true|answer=(Remain silent)
|...}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''You don't love anyone, you only love yourself!''
