{{dialogue|Justice|Whaddya mean you don't know what it is? You're a carpenter, ain't ya? How many kinds of tables could there be?}}
{{dialogue|Rian|The table lore runs deep, my dude... Though, yes, I am indeed a carpenter of incalcuable skill... I...  uh... actually, dude, dunno what to tell you; I'm stumped. Looks like it's got a 'lil robot thing goin' on on the inside though. Does that help?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Er, yeah, I noticed... Was just hoping you might have a little more insight on the subject. That's alright, pal. Good hustle. Luckily I also grabbed Director Qi here for a second opinion! Go ahead, Qi. Tell us about the, uh... robot thing.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Procured from the Paradise Lost Hazardous Ruins?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah, I was down there... thought I heard something that sounded like rain. Then... I heard voices... So I turned the corner, weapon drawn...!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|But there was nothin'. Just this weird lookin' table in the center of the room. I've never seen anything like it before, there was something so alluring about the idea of bringing it to the surface... Wait a sec, this thing is starting to sound cursed. Is this thing cursed...?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hm...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hmmmm...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|...Yeah!?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Nope. No idea. Never seen it.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Tch. Ahh... Strike two, then. Hey, ''Player''! How's it going? Ever seen one of these before?}}

*''Might be a weapon.''
*''Might be a toy.''
*''It's clearly just a table.''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Might be a weapon.
|You may be onto something. I shook it a bit and heard a bunch of pieces of something rattling around inside. Bullets or shrapnel... pretty insidious of someone to make a... table bomb...?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=Might be a toy.
|A toy, huh? I dunno, I'm not really havin' any fun. Are you? Shook it up, there's a bunch of junk in there. Maybe there's a prize inside?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=It's clearly just a table.
|Normal table you say? Ahaha... ''Player''! You should know as well as anyone, there's almost always more than meets the eye with any kind of Old World junk...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Mm. Yes. The mathematical analysis of this game could make for a fine enough afternoon. Mr. Justice, sir, I believe I can take things from here. Clearly this table is a simple game machine, and nothing that poses a threat to anyone here in Sandrock.}}
