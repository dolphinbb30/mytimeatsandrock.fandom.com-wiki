{{dialogue|Owen|We all know The Breach, it's a pivotal source of relics and ores for our town. But not everyone knows what The Breach actually is...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|It's known that most people in the Old World worked non-labor intensive jobs. AIs and other machines did most of the manual work. People instead focused on things like entertainment, research, finances, and other things that we don't really understand.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|To the best of our knowledge, The Breach was once a building that allowed people to work in offices.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The world became crowded, and the only way to build was up! Some people think that The Breach may have actually extended out of our atmosphere and into outer space, making it a literal skyscraper!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|But now, the building has sunk so deep into the earth, revealing only the top floors to us, so any guesses as to its actual height are all pure speculation.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|We're not sure what all of the people in the Old World Breach did, but we're able to dig up relics of all kinds thanks to the variety of companies that used to exist there.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|The year was 76 on the Peach Calendar, conflict was on the rise again on the borders of the Free Cities and the Duvos Empire.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The Free Cities sent all their best and brightest up north to the front, to defend our lands.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The Lucien Border conflict was one of the most violent and terrible wars in all our time here on the surface; mainly due to the newest developments in technology used by Duvos and our own tech supplied by Vega 5.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|If Lucien falls, then the way to the heart of the Alliance, Atara, would have opened up for the empire. It was a desperate time.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Two brave knights made a name for themselves by regularly being on the frontline for nearly the entire war: two brothers.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|After two exhausting years of defending the border, Duvos unveiled their ultimate weapon: the Dreadnought. A mobile castle decorated in cannons and guns from top to bottom.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The younger brother was destroyed by a blast from this weapon, sending the older one into a rage. The older brother single-handedly boarded the Dreadnought and began dispatching Duvos soldiers like they were made of butter.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The older brother found his way into the core of this machine and destroyed it; the explosion formed a massive crater that can still be seen today, not far from the settlement of Legar.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|But in the aftermath, neither of their bodies were found.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Shortly after, Duvos relented in their attacks, but what happened to the two brothers is still a mystery to this day.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Now, I've never been out there myself, but I've heard tales from those brave enough to enter those treacherous lands: some call them the Rangers of the Peripheries.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Everyone knows that the Peripheries to the west are pretty much permanently uninhabitable; no one's ever made it more than a few hundred leagues in these and lived to tell the tale. And the legends of horrifying beasts, out of control AIs, lost super weapons... well, don't even get me started.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|From what I've heard, there are a lot of fine relics in there. But since it's too dangerous, no one's ever dared to bring 'em out.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|So this one's a real headscratcher... y'see, a lot of people wonder why Sandrock was called Sandrock, seein' as back in the day, there was actually a big forest around the oasis. Not too sandy, not too rocky, either. So what gives?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Well, back then, no one had discovered the oasis; the Eufaula Desert is mighty vast, afterall. When Martle and her squad made it to this part of the continent, they did a lot of exploring in the desert and called themselves "The Sandrock Crew."}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Actually there was some debate about that, as I recall. Some wanted 'em to call themselves the Rocksand crew, but, you know, majority rule.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Anyway, their settlement was called Sandrock village, and then eventually just "Sandrock."}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Martle's crew moved on, and she stayed. People always thought it was weird that such a lush place was called Sandrock, but, well, nobody wonders about that anymore...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Legend has it that about 20 years ago, in Walnut Groove, there was a talent competition, and at that competition a young guitar player stepped on stage and played, objectively, the greatest song in the world.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Now you might be thinkin', "Owen, how could anybody say that they played objectively 'the best song in the world?' Isn't music a matter of personal preference, a subjective thing?"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Well, be that as it may, every single person in the audience agreed, it was the greatest song they'd ever heard, and it has gone down in history as such.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|What happened next is they tried to sign him up for the biggest talent agency in Walnut Groove; they found out he was a country boy who couldn't read or write... but boy could he play that guitar, just like ringin' a bell.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Next they planned a big show, the pressure was massive. Everyone wanted to hear the best song in the world. Half the Alliance was there.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|But when that picker went on stage and plugged in his guitar... he just stood there, not playing a note.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Everyone thought he was trying to build anticipation, but... after a few minutes, he went up to the microphone, sweat drippin' off his head onto the stage, and he says, "I... FORGOT THE SONG!"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Then he ran off! Never to be seen or heard from again...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Nobody caught his name, nobody took his picture, and nobody remembers what that song sounded like. So only the people there at that talent show that day have ever heard the greatest song in the world.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|That mad picker could be anywhere now. He could even be among us... Boy, that'd be something, huh?}}

{{dialogue|Owen|In any case, it's rumored that these talking animals all came from the same place, some kind of Old World laboratory where they used to do experiments on animals...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Once upon a time there was a Brave Little Bumble Ant and a mean old Rocket Rooster who lived about thirty meters apart from the ant colony on a sand dune. Somewhere out east, I reckon...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|See, all the Bumble Ants had to pass through some area that the Rocket Rooster had deemed it's "territory" in order to get to one of the cactii forests where they get their nectar from, and sure enough, that mean ole Rocket Rooster would shoot its fireworks at the ants every single time they went by.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|One day they'd had enough, and the Bumble Ants recruited their bravest Bumble Ant to go talk to that Rocket Rooster.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So the Brave Little Bumble Ant went over to the Rocket Rooster's nest and shouted, "Hey! Rocket Rooster! Why do you keep shooting fireworks at me and my friends!?"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The Rocket Rooster raised an eyebrow and replied calmly, "Because I loathe the heirarchy by which your society operates, Bumble Ant!"}}
{{dialogue|Owen|"Uhhhh, what the heck?" replied the Bumble Ant.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|"You heard me! Or are your ears filled with honey!? You Bumble Ants follow your Bumble Queen without question! You work hard to turn cactus nectar into honey, and then you are forced to throw that honey at those that would threaten your livelihood!" shouted the Rocket Rooster.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|"The very fruit of your labor is tossed away and destroyed! The pointlessness of your cyclical existence infuriates me, and so I must continue to fire projectiles in your direction whenever I see you!" he continued.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|After thinking about it for a while, the Bumble Ant realized that the Rocket Rooster was making a lot of sense, so the Brave Little Bumble Ant went back home and organized his friends to overthrow the Bumble Ant Queen and create a more equitable society.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Which explains why you never see a Bumble Ant Queen. Curiously though, the Bumble Ants still throw their honey at anyone who ticks 'em off...}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Once upon a time, there was a colony of monkeys who wanted to choose a leader for themselves and start organizing a system of monkey government.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|They deliberated for a long time over how to choose their leader, but eventually their process was interrupted by a monkey who was really good at dancing.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The dancing monkey danced all over the tables and jumped through the air with finesse, to everyone's delight.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Then, it was settled. Everyone was so entertained by the monkey's dance, they decided to make him leader of the monkey government.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|For a while, everything was fine. All the monkeys had lots of fun. Whenever there was a problem in the monkey community, they would go to the leader, and he would do a little dance, and then everyone would feel better.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|One day, though, a group of evil monkeys came to the monkey colony and threatened to harm them.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The monkeys went to their monkey leader and asked him what to do, but all he knew how to do was dance.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The monkeys begged their leader to come up with a solution, but he just danced and danced.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Then the evil monkeys attacked and everyone died. The end.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|The moral of this story: don't choose your leaders based on a popularity contest.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Researchers at the time identified them as helper AI that had once worked in the space stations up in the sky, but they must've hit their heads or somethin', cause when they landed here, they just started robbing people non-stop!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|It's theorized that something about their AI logic programming made them somehow arrive at the conclusion that the best way to fulfill their purpose, whatever that might be, was to steal things from people. Whatever the case, they were relentless.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Their metal bodies were tough, and they'd rarely miss with a shootin' iron, so whenever they came your way, your best bet was just to give up and hand over your goods.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Back in the Age of Darkness, everybody lived underground. The calamity caused all kinds of crazy mutant monsters to be born, so everybody in the tunnels had to be packin' some serious heat.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Some Blacksmiths were just as legendary as the Knights- with the right weapon, anybody could be a hero in the Age of Darkness.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|But as things got safer, and eventually, once people made it back up to the surface, there wasn't much need for such advanced weaponry anymore, and, well, with the people who still remembered the Old World tech and how it worked dying out... relic weapons stopped getting made, and the Blacksmiths were no more.}}

{{dialogue|Owen|Now here's a favorite of mine...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Back when Martle and Mort stuck around after many people left after the initial great relic rush, the two of them tried to make the most of what was left of Sandrock.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|They noticed real quick that after adventurers had cut down so much of the forest and trees, sand was starting to blow over the remaining greenery. The result was... pretty much what you see here today.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Still, Mort and Martle were committed to keepin' this place alive, so they started trying all sorts of weird things to make the soil better.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Though things were looking grim, they always tried to keep their spirits high by doing little things for each other; they used to stick straw into the sand and write messages: "I love you," "Happy birthday," "Take a bath," you know, cutesy stuff like that.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Turns out straw sticks in the sand for a long time, and it actually slows down the sand that gets blown across the desert!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Just by maintaining a positive outlook and being cheery, they made a huge discovery that was just the thing we needed to turn the tide on the sandstorms! Kinda inspiring, don't ya think?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I mean, I guess you could say that the book they found on Old World agricultural techniques has played a greater role in our recovery, but, eh... I think the story is better just leaving that part out...}}
