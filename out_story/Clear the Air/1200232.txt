If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|A gust of wind blew in, and it smelled of... Starberries...? Is this your doing, ''Player''? Well, I won't question your methods. I far prefer the fragrance of Starberries to... whatever it was we had before.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Man, if I were still with Logan, he'd let me go down into that valley. I would've neutralized the green stuff and punched a couple of Bandirats, just like you did! But nope, I'm in Sandrock now, I just go to school...}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Thank goodness you got rid of that pollution, it was starting to affect the traffic to my shop! At first I thought there might be opportunity in this crisis. As it turned out, it was just a crisis.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I wish I could've been more help in the canyon, but, well... it's like Miguel always says: "when it comes to dangerous situations, having you around is more of a liability than an asset!" Haha! So true.}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Wow. So the green gas was a leftover product from the Old World... a useless, dangerous material that people kept crankin' out for profit, right up til the very end. There really should be limits on what businesses can and can't do...}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Green gas is all gone? Well, easy come, easy go, as they say. I think we coulda co-opted it, turned it into a Sandrock tradition. Way I see it, only the true Sandrockers would subject themselves to such foulness, which is to say, one would have to truly love Sandrock to tolerate the green gas. Coulda cut out a lot of the gristle I tell you what...}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Alright, you convinced us! We're staying! You know... ''Player''... without you around, I'm not sure I would've changed my mind. You're like some kind of... super Builder!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|So all the pollution's gone now? Dang it, ''Player'', think of the missed prank opportunities! Okay, okay... I guess it is... a pretty picture perfect example of Age of Corruption technology. I wonder if Qi will reinvent it for me if I tell him it came from space...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|So it turns out the gas was a pollutant, even in the Old World? And they just kept making it, knowing it was dangerous? I can hardly believe such one-dimensional villains could ever exist in real life...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I think you and the rest of the Civil Corps deserve a pay raise. In Atara, they have different divisions trained to handle different problems. In Sandrock, you guys are the police, firemen, and apparently hazmat removal... probably other stuff, too. Kudos.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Nice work in the valley, ''Player''! Really clutch! Musa's really coming around on the whole "we're not dumb, actually" thing, in large part because of you!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|What would drive the people of the Age of Corruption to create something so pointless? Gas that turns people green? Did they not have anything else practical that needed making? I take a certain pride in knowing each of the tools I forge will one day make the world a better place... for at least someone.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|My Ma said she's super relieved that you helped stop the pollution. If you didn't do anything... I guess we'd all just be green forever! Which... Well... I guess we don't want that...}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|The same customers who complained about being turned green on the train a while ago approached me and said they wanted to get back on the "green train!" I told them it's fixed and they were disappointed. There really is no pleasing some people...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Hey, just so you know: after all this time as a Civil Corps member, your accomplishments have far, far exceeded any requirement that may have been necessary to reach deputy. I, er... I just feel like after Captain, it should really be Unsuur next. You understand, right?}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|Bandirats! I hate those things! Good on ya for showin' 'em what for. The real victims here are the good, honest rats out there, havin' their name besmirched by these lowlifes! Oh, and Pebbles is fine now, don't worry!}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Cooper handled this whole 'green' incident remarkably well. Usually anything new or brightly colored puts him immediately into fight-or-flight mode. This was both! And he was fine. Breakthrough.}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|That green substance you found... I was thinking of doing a sermon on it, but... it's just so on the nose. Toxic, bad for the environment, no real function... I really can't think of anything nice to say about the people who came up with such an idea.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Good job taking care of that green pollutant! I'm glad Justice decided to step up and help out; Trudy and I aren't as tough as you guys. Teach me your moves sometime! Builder punch, hah! ...Heh... No? Yeah, that's alright, we'll "workshop" that one...}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|I... must admit your tenacity is admirable. If only we had others like you, perhaps you wouldn't be spread so thin. Ahem. Well done, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|No child should have to grow up in a polluted environment. You've done a great deed, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|One thing I do have to admit, you Sandrockers keep getting back up again, no matter how hard you get knocked down... The boss of the salvage company insisted that was important, and I tend to agree.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I did end up trying those green eggs, this customer kept pressuring me. Well, in any case, those eggs were terrible! I wouldn't eat them in the rain, I wouldn't eat them on a train. Here, there, or... anywhere! Ahem. Just some... food for thought.}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|That green gas could've been a devastating weapon at a fashion show... all the models turned green in an instant! Hm... why did my mind immediately go there...? I need to meditate more.}}
{{dialogue|Pen|Really glad you and the Civil Corps handled that whole valley ordeal, Skinny... I'm too pretty to be green.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|If you ever get any other samples of hazardous materials, feel free to bring them back here for me to neutralize them. I may or may not be "in the zone" right now...}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Hey, hope you can forgive me and Dan-bi for thinking about leaving. She really just wants what's best for our future child. And I... well, I just do whatever she tells me to so...}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|You said you ran into a bunch of Ban-dee-rats down in the canyon? One o' them pinheads stole my favorite rock n' roll poster back in '92. You give 'em heck, Builder. Sock 'em one for your ol' pal, Rocky.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I've been talking with Musa since you all handled the green pollution incident and... well, I think I like our chances!}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|I'm glad Justice volunteered us to go into that canyon with you. Now I have this cool suit that I can wear around the house and pretend like I'm in space.}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|I can't for the life of me figure out why someone would find turnin' green entertainin'! Just uh-uh!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Quick word? So... you and the Civil Corps... it's great that you have new pals or whatever, but I don't want to see you neglecting your duties to run around playing Yakboy, got it? While you were in the valley, I actually had to do a comm- I mean... A whole mess of commissions! Better straighten up and fly right, else I'll be taking my overtime fees out of your salary! Glad we had this talk.}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Y'know, I still have that suit one of you Builders made back from the Shipwreck thing. Woulda gone down to that canyon if anyone had asked...}}
