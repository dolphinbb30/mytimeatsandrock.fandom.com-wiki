If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|After meeting with so many people from all over at the summit, it gave me some great insights as to what I could do at my shop to have more international presence. But to be honest, I don't really feel like going through all that right now. Maybe in a year or two.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Man, I dunno how much more of this calm I can take... Seems like nothin's ever goin' on anymore! I'm about ready to return to a life of crime; somebody needs to breathe some life back into this place!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|I think I overestimated the number of people who would want Sandrock Quinquennial temporary tattoos. What do you think the odds are we'll have it here again next time?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Now that Sandrock is so safe and juicy, there's not much for me to do. One of my favorite new pastimes is to go look back at the newsboard. There are so many articles that somehow just passed me by!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|No major commissions on the horizon, eh? Never been a better time to visit Catori World!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Yes, yes, you saved the world. Congratulations, ''Player''. What, you want another pat on the back? We already gave you like six awards! Never enough for some people, I tell you what...}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Whew! These days, when I want to plant new trees, I have to go further and further out into the forest. What can I say though, it's a good problem to have!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|No more bandits, no more Duvos, no more sandstorms... It's weird being at a stage of life with nothing to be mad at. Where's that old commissioner of yours!? He'd be a fine enough nemesis...! Oh. Right. Jail...}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|Hm... Hard to find inspiration these days. Not much happening, you know? Is it bad that... I wish we could have another whodunnit on our hands?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|Much quieter these days... More pleasant walks while searching for herbs...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Wanna try something new at the Blue Moon? Huh? Adventure? ''Player'', haven't we had enough adventure for a lifetime? This isn't like those pulp action books where the hero saves the world every six months; relax a bit! We've all earned it.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|You know what our city needs...? ...Er... Sorry, that wasn't meant to be a rhetorical question. I genuinely don't know what we ought to build next... Well. Er... I'll get back to you!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|This is what we fought for, ''Player''. Days like this... where nothin' in particular is going on. Well. If there was ever any equipment upgrade you'd been putting off, now'd be the time...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Now that the summit's over, there's a lot less going on in Sandrock. Much easier to stop the kids from all running over to look out the window every ten minutes...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Do I look older to you? I feel like I'm still the same age as when you first came to town!}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|You know... through it all... I'll bet you didn't think I'd be able to weigh in on literally every major event that has ever happened in this town and somehow always make it about trains, did you? Well. You're not the only one capable of amazing achievements!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|You hear that, ''Player''? Exactly. Silence. No varmints out there, no double agents lurking in the shadows, no mutants bent on world domination... Just peace... and quiet. You know, I think maybe it's time I take up a new hobby. What have you heard about knitting?}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|How was ridin' up in that airship? Yeah, I'll bet! I can't wait to try for myself. All these years down in the ruins, kind puts your head in the clouds, know what I mean?}}
{{dialogue|Larry|Because of your heroic building, Xena and I have now deemed this place stable enough to begin investing in our child's college savings fund! You don't perchance know off the top of your head how many bugs are required to go to college in human world, do you? That's fine. I'll look it up!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Been quiet lately. But I still do occasionally find caves out in the wilds I've never seen before. Might yet be some stones left unturned...}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Howdy, ''Player''! Hm... feelin' kinda blue? I don't blame you. We just went through so much and now it's all peace and quiet...Well, if you're lookin' for somethin' to do, why not say "hello" to someone you've never met!}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Hm... lot of slow days, now that we're back in the glory days, huh...? That's what they don't tell ya, I guess. Oh, well. Slow is good! Peaceful. Plenty of time to think, and... really enjoy everything we worked for!}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|A successful summit in Sandrock... Never thought I'd see the day. The Light truly has chosen to bless this town...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Not sure how much time I have left but... ''Player'', I'll enjoy every moment in this Sandrock we've restored. Thank you, ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Musa|I'll bet you're wondering, "Hey, if Musa owns and operates all these businesses, how could he possibly have time to just aimlessly wander around Sandrock from time to time?" ...Well. Goodbye.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|It's strange... these days I kind of feel like life in Sandrock is as peaceful as it ever was in Highwind... How about you? Keeping busy...?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Whew... Heard any good stories since the summit? Uh huh... yeah, me neither. Guess things are winding down for a bit. Not to worry! I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the next big adventure comes our way! Could be any minute! Yep... any time now...}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|Business was booming up through the summit, now things have leveled out. But when I was making more, I got used to the lavish lifestyle and now the old normal is never enough anymore... What have you done to me, ''Player''!?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|There's reason to believe that nearly all possible locations for ruins within a five league radius have been discovered. Have you visited them all?}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Not much goin' on in Sandrock these days. And I hardly need to tell you, that suits me juuuust fiiiiine...}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Kinda hard to believe, even after being the host of a Alliance summit, we're still the only salvage company in town. Ah, well. Better not jinx it!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Hum... The one drawback to getting everything orderly in this town is... now everything kind of runs on its own! Well... here's hoping someone has something to announce at the next fireside!}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|"The game's over. What are you still doing here?" ...That's something I read on a popsicle stick the other day. Weird thing to write on a popsicle stick, huh? What game could they possibly have been talking about? Well. Just thought I'd share.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Everything changed so much in Sandrock... from when you arrived up until the summit. Did I change, too...? Well, I must have. I've been here the whole time!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|It's been a long time since you arrived here in Sandrock... you're older and wiser now. Just never get too old for your grandma, you hear?}}
{{dialogue|Wei|We may be one of the top guilds in the Free Cities, but don't get too cozy: that's how we'll get knocked off from our spot!}}
{{dialogue|Xena|It's so peaceful these days. Is the world better without conquest? I suppose only time will tell...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|With all the big stuff out of the way, now's the perfect chance to try growing new plants. You haven't... planted everything there is to plant yet, have you? That'd make you just as neurotic as... me.}}
