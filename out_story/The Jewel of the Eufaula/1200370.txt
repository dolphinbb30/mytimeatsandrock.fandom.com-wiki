Townsfolk respond to the event:

{{dialogue|Albert|Recently I've made some progress with my love life. In the end, my significant other didn't really care for what I wore... how 'bout that!}}

{{dialogue|Avery|Be wary of basking in the soothing embrace of glory. We've won the battle, but the specter of conflict is still on the horizon. Nevertheless, enjoy this moment. The Alliance thanks you for your service.}}

{{dialogue|Castile|I'm sorry you all had to be the site of a skirmish. As someone who's been through it, I know it can be hard. But... take some solace in the fact that you all handled yourselves brilliantly.}}

{{dialogue|Curie|You all have made rather impressive technological progress here in Sandrock. Perhaps we ought to do more exchanges, share our knowledge. Though I'm not sure how Qi will take to that...}}

{{dialogue|Gale|''Player''! Congratulations! I heard from Mayor Trudy that after you arrived in Sandrock, there were tremendous changes! As it happens, we have a Builder in Portia who has skills not unlike your own. Perhaps one day we can arrange a... meeting of the minds...!}}

{{dialogue|Gaudi|Congrats, Builder! Your achievements are truly amazing. As a fellow Builder, I wonder if I can send my apprentices to your Workshop for some proper training? They're all dying for a chance to learn from a living legend.}}

{{dialogue|Gustave|We're quite proud that one of our Builders has been your partner throughout all this. I hope you were able to count on her, she certainly looks up to you, as do all the rest of us.}}

{{dialogue|Kaya|You've done us proud, ''Player''. When you make it back home, we'll do you a parade, we'll give you the key to the city... the whole shebang!}}

{{dialogue|Li-Jun|Wow, so much cultural and entertainment output here... You Sandrockers are really giving us a run for our money...!}}

{{dialogue|Ling|We'll never forget how surprised we were to find out that you all held off the Duvos invasion for so long! Those guys made a big mistake in trying to knock over the most tenacious people in all the Free Cities!}}

{{dialogue|Mint|Hey, if you ever get the chance, it would be nice to have you visit Portia. It's a lovely place!}}
