{{dialogue|Grace|Altair One, Vega 5, Olympia: none of that rings a bell?}}

{{dialogue|Grace|Ugh...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Do you all have to do this here...?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Obviously we're not compelled by any greater power to be here, but this is the Research Center, and we're doing research, so I'm going to go with "yes."}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Research... can this exercise in futility really be quantified as research? The AI's memory banks have been damaged, as I discovered from a cursory examination upon our initial encounter. Hence my disinterest in the subject. No offense, Rosy.}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|NONE taken. ANYMORE...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|You don't get anywhere by giving up when your first lead turns into a dead end. I wanted to keep probing to see if Rosy did have some memories locked away... Any snippet of information that could teach us about the Old World...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I did tell you that AI cannot lie...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|We wanted to consult an expert in the field.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I am an expert in every field.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Hey, Director! Thanks so much for letting us use your space, I think we're about to wrap things up anyway... Hey! Is that a... half-finished formula I see over there on your desk?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh! Why, yes it is. I was calculating the cubic weight of rocket fuel that might be required to reach the moon, should our technology ever catch up to that point. You know, just in case.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Right! You never know...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes, how silly of me to leave it incomplete in favor of attending this rather unpressing get-together. No matter. Should only take a bit longer. Just a bit of rocket science; not exactly brain surgery...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Anyway, good luck with your fruitless endeavors.}}

{{dialogue|Grace|And good luck with yours.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Nice to see you two getting along.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Hey, ''Player''. Yeah. I'm sorry I put you up to all this, Heidi. I really thought we'd be able to get something groundbreaking, heck, at the least borderline useful out of this thing. ...No offense, Rosy.}}
{{dialogue|Magic Mirror|SO uselessâ™«~!}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Nah... As soon as you pitched me the idea, I was on board! So was ''Player''! And, hey, it's like you said, this isn't over. We might be able to figure something out sooner or later.}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Rosy, is there any way you think you could get your memory banks restored?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Great. Anyone have an All-Source lying around?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Fresh out, I'm afraid!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Hm... Yeah, we might really be at a dead end for now... Unless... I wonder if there's anything we could ask her... about herself? ''Player'', you've spent the most time with Rosy, what observations have you made?}}
