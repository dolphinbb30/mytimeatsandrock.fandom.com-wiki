If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|''Player''... when you were gone, I... I realized there were so many things between us left unsaid. Let's let this be a lesson... to cherish those close to us... and to... really talk to each other, you know?}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Heh heh heh... all according to plan... that's right, ''Player''. I'm in the know... I'm the nose. And the nose knows, ''Player''. The nose knows.}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|Oh, ''Player'', when I thought you were gone, it was the first time I felt fear in Sandrock... I thought, how could someone so strong be gone just like that! I'm so glad you're alive!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|''Player'', you're alive! Yippee! Hooray! This is the first miracle I've ever witnessed in person! You'd think it'd be more with all the praying and what not but... Anyway, best day ever!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|When we thought you were... gone. It was a strange moment. Of course, we were all shook to our core. But it brought everyone together in a way, too. I guess I never realized... A lot of people in town care about you, just like I do.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Well, look who it is! Back from the dead! 'Course, I always knew you were fakin' it.  ''Player'' I know ain't gettin taken out by gravity! No, sir, it'd take... an army... of killer bees! With machetes. And heat vision! Or... something of equivilent vehemence. Ah... this all reminds me of the time I faked my own death...}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Oh, ''Player''! I prayed to the Light you'd be okay! You better thank your lucky stars you've got folks up there backing you up!}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|''Player''! When I heard you had that ridin' accident... Listen! You and me are gonna start goin' ridin' a lot more, alright? We're gonna start doin' drills. I don't wanna ever have to worry about somethin' like that happenin' to you again, you hear me!?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|''Player''. Glad to have you back among the living. How frightful to think... one day someone could be out on the town, full of life, brightening the world around you and then... gone. Let's live each day to our fullest, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Fang|You are... unharmed? This is good news. Please visit my clinic... if you discover injuries...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|You're really something, you know that, ''Player''? Ah? No, I'm not blamin' you for what happened... I'm just sayin'... You're really somethin'!}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|Well, you know what they say. Sometimes you get the goat, sometimes the goat gets you. But not today, ''Player''. Today, you're a survivor. Welcome back.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Everyone tried to hide the truth from me when they thought you were dead, so I didn't have to go through that whole emotional whirlwind like everyone else. Thanks, adults! ...I guess?}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Just before you arrived, I shared that... I knew every time I looked up at the station you built, I'd be thinking of you. And then everyone chimed in with all the things you built for them, too! You've... helped us all so much, ''Player''. I'm glad you're okay!}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|Scared us half to death with that stunt of yours, ''Player''! Make sure you talk to Rocky, he took it real hard when he got the news, he's probably got a whole bunch of feelings he needs to work through now...}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Oh, ''Player'', when I heard the news... I felt like I was losing not just a neighbor, not just a friend, but... like I lost a child of my own. You... be careful out there, you hear? And come around more from now on, too, alright?}}
{{dialogue|Matilda|''Player'', ''Player'', ''Player''... I think someone up there is watching over you. You ought to count your lucky stars and count 'em well! Push your luck like that again, and, well... I don't even want to think about what could happen.}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|You scared us all to death, ''Player''! Listen... we've been through so much, and... We started this together, we're gonna finish it together, okay?}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Your latest caper... a rather miraculous occurence, and a welcome result to be sure. Perhaps this is the Light's way of saying it's not quite done with you yet...}}
{{dialogue|Mort|To see a child leave this world before myself... I'm glad I did not have to experience such a thing again. How... selfish of me. ''Player'', it's truly a blessing that you are alive.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|''Player''...! Man, you really scared us you know! Not the... "spirit" thing, that was all in good fun, classic you. I mean when we thought we really lost you!}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|So glad you made it, ''Player''! Of course, I knew you'd be fine. Dying is so last season. And that's so not you!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|When I heard about the accident, I dared not calculate your probability of survival. I feared the number would be... disheartening. In retrospect, I see that was a mistake. Perhaps I could have been the one to find you, as you did for me all that time ago. In any case, exuberant to have you among the living again.}}
{{dialogue|Rian|Dude... not cool. I really thought you were gone. I was like... really sad and stuff.}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Ah, ''Player''! I can't believe we almost lost you! When we heard the news, Krystal started cryin'. Then I started cryin'! Then the boys started cryin'. Then Pebbles burped. He's such a little trooper!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Oh, I hoped and hoped that you would somehow be okay, ''Player''... I'm going to have a word with that Civil Corps; it seems like these missions they're bringing you on just keep getting more and more dangerous!}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Nice stunt, pretending to die. I stared at a rock for hours and hours and felt the worst I've ever felt ever. You got me good.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Did it hurt when you fell off the cliff? I bet it did! You need to make sure you rest up, don't go down into the ruins for a while!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|Oh, you're back! You're back! Don't you ever scare your grandma like that again, you hear? Have you ever considered wearing safety pads out there riding around? You should!}}
{{dialogue|Yan|Sometimes, you're nothing but trouble, hear me newbie? I have to uncash your life insurance check, plus, no doubt they're going to want to uncommission your gravestone. Do you have any idea how much time it took me to put that up? Almost an hour! Next time you plan on dying, make sure you finish the job! I don't want to hear about anyone in my guild cutting corners, hear me?}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|I didn't want to believe it when I heard the news. I thought... maybe I was responsible. To have you out there, chasing after some old man's dream... Please be careful out there, ''Player''. I know you want to help Sandrock but... always care for yourself first.}}
