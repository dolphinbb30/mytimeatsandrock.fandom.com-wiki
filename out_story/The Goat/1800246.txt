*''Your goat seems to be very smart.''
*''Have you ever done anything bad?''
*{{flirt}}''I fell in love with you at first sight.''
*''There's nothing more I want to ask.''

{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=Your Pa was a good man.
|He was. Never shot anything that didn't need shootin'. Always put the town ahead of himself. From the time I could walk, I wanted to follow in his footsteps.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|He taught me everything I know. How to fight, how to hunt, how to be a decent man. And now, I'll never get a chance to return any favors...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=Your goat seems to be very smart.
|Bout as smart as he is stubborn. Comes with the territory, being a goat and all. But we care for our goats, me and Haru. Raised 'em up from when they were just kids. Rambo's the smart one and Merle is a bit of a hothead.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Truth be told they both take after Haru more than me. He's always teachin' 'em new tricks. Back when Andy was around we'd all train 'em together. Heh. Look at me ramblin' on.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=Have you ever done anything bad?
|Yeah. I ain't proud of everything I did out here. But I can tell you one thing: {{textcolor|green|I did it all to protect Sandrock.}}}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|When all this is over, if I make it, I'll do time for everything I done wrong.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=I fell in love with you at first sight.
|Huh...? But we've only just...}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|Let's... save anything like that for after the mission.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|answer=There's nothing more I want to ask.
|I think I've made myself clear. If you still have doubts, not sure what more we can say. We do need your help, though, Builder. I'll do whatever it takes to earn that.}}
{{dialogue|Logan|indent=true|We'll stick around here for a little while but... we do need to be movin' on...}}
