{{dialogue|Qi|...Shot into space, you say?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|That's right. Straight into space! I couldn't believe it. Heck, I had no idea there were spaceships there at all! Loada bunkers, stairs, factory lookin' things. Saw a bunch of spaceship parts, man, it was huge! Never seen anythin' like it...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|...Did you happen to see... the name of the ship?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah, it was like, "Olive Pea" or something. I figured it was some sorta space food delivery service or somethin'.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The Olympia...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Uh... yeah, that coulda been it, too. I mean, the food stuff was just a theory... Matilda was in that robot, and came real close to me. I jus' thought back to my training, and...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Olympia... found the Olympia...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Haha... haha... hahaha!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I need to go... It's finally here... I've waited so long for this moment...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Uh... are you okay Director...?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Okay?! I'm way more than okay! This is fascinating! Do you know what this means?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|That... I have to take you there...?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|It means that the people of the Old World really did travel to the stars! When the Day of Calamity happened, there were people out there amongst the stars! They probably survived! And yes, you have to take me there...!}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Oh hey ''Player'', just in time. Director Qi wants to know more about the Olympathing, maybe you can enlighten him? I've got uh... things to do, so I've gotta run, seeya!}}

(cId 1) A conversation 3593_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh yes! I'm still wondering about Matilda's mech. The Sheriff said it's got an escape mechanism that's strong enough to send the control pod into space. That's incredible!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The energy output must've been massive to be able to move such a heavy object to escape velocity. It must have even out-produced the R47 Ultra! I'm so glad that-}}
{{dialogue|Qi|...I feel like this conversation is very one sided, ''Player''. It is almost as if you did not come to discuss the wonders of robotics.}}

*''I found this chip...''
*''Could we add thrusters to the cockpit?''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Could we add thrusters to the cockpit?
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=3}}|I cannot deny that the thought has crossed my mind... It could prove useful in dire situations for the control pod to have an escape function... but based on the best available technology that we have, it would significantly enlarge the structure itself.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|The mobile suit would require fuel tanks for the thrusters, which would introduce further combat vulnerabilities.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|If we balanced it correctly it shouldn't affect flight dynamics, however having fuel tanks attached to the control pod would be a constant risk.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Exciting.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Ah, but I assume you had something else to talk to me about?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hm? A chip? Let me take a look...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|You found this in the Mecha-Tilda? Wait a minute... this looks familiar... hang on, I'll be right back.}}
