NPC in-mission talks:

{{dialogue|Yan|Hey, quick word: do you think you're actually going to finish Rocky's commission? If it's not happening, I really need you to let me know, cause train ticket prices always go up the closer you get to your departure date...}}

{{dialogue|Yan|So you did finish that commission, huh! Well, what do ya know? Looks like I'm an even better supervisor than I thought!}}
