{{dialogue|Owen|Hey! There's my darling ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I wanted to talk to you about this idea I had for the Blue Moon: I want to turn one of my stories into a play! Could really class up the joint, know what I mean?}}

*''Sounds good, need any stage props built?''
*''Maybe I can help？''
*''Think you could really pull it off?''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Sounds good, need any stage props built?
|reward={{NPC2|Owen|rp=2}}|Haha, that's why you're the best in the biz. Always ready to pick up the Pickhammer!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Maybe I can help？
|reward={{NPC2|Owen|rp=2}}|Well... yeah! That's exactly what I was thinking!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Think you could really pull it off?
|Won't know unless I try! And...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|I was actually hoping... um... have you ever had any acting experience...?}}

*''I'll be the star of the show!''
*''I have stage fright...''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I'll be the star of the show!
|I promise.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I have stage fright...
|It's okay, babe. I'd be right there the whole time. I wouldn't let anything bad happen and... if it was going south, I'd just step in and improvise a way to get you out of there!}}

:*''Just kidding, I was acting just now!''
:*''You promise you'll help?''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=Just kidding, I was acting just now!
|Woah, you are good! I didn't know that about you, babe!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=double|answer=You promise you'll help?
|I promise.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So, ah... is that a 'yes?' Are you in...?}}

*''Yeah, let's do it!''
*''I might not have time actually...''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I might not have time actually...
|Oh, shoot. Well, do let me know if you get time. I think it'd be a really great thing for us to do together as a couple! But, er, no pressure or anything!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|That's great! This is going to be a lot of fun... and you... You are going to take to the stage brilliantly, I can already see it!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Let me show you a bit of what I've got for the script...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So, here's the Crane Lift pitch: there's this guy wandering through the desert, he's like... he's lost. Both literally and metaphorically. He sees this speck of green in the middle of a sandy dune; no other life to speak of...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|So, then he gets a bit closer, and it turns out... the tree is alive! It's the magical Evergreen of the desert... they have a bit of discourse; traveler has an epiphany and finds a direction for his life. That's the gist of it.}}

*''Sounds riveting!''
*''You want me to be the tree!?''
*''Eh... I dunno, could maybe use a twist or something.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=You want me to be the tree!?
|Oh, uh... yeah... it doesn't sound so great when you put it like that. But, uh, listen! It's not like the school play when the teacher makes the kid she doesn't like be a tree in the background...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|This isn't a background tree, this is a tree spirit. I mean, the tree in my script is one of the main characters! And uh... you know, it's Sandrock themed. I thought a pro-tree message would resonate with our target audience...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Eh... I dunno, could maybe use a twist or something.
|Eh, yeah, well, it's less of a traditional drama and more of a... think piece! Not a lot happens, true, but... it feels like a lot happens because we see our characters go through so many emotions...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Er... Just give it a chance! I think you'll really like it by the end...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Okay, can we... Let's just... run a couple of lines. No time like the present, right? This is the scene where our characters meet for the first time... Ahem!}}
The conversation ends.
