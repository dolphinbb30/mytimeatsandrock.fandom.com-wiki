{{dialogue|Trudy|Ah, ''Player''! Join us for a word? There's something we could use your help on!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We've known it for some time now, but now other people are starting to see... Sandrock's roaring ahead! I've been receiving quite a few inquiries from people thinking of moving here...}}
{{dialogue|Jane|I've been contacted by parents looking to enroll their children, too!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|So! We were thinking about{{textcolor|green| fixing up a few homes}} around town for potential new residents. Maybe expanding the Old Town Lodge a bit...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Old Town Lodge should be no problem. And as it happens, I've had a few places in mind for renovation as well. Just need to start writing up the commissions!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Perfect. Well, what do you say, ''Player''? Sounds like an open and shut case for an ace Builder such as yourself!}}

*''I'm on it!''

*''See, I've got this plate... and there's a lot on it...''

{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=I'm on it!
|That's great, ''Player''! I can already see Sandrock as lovely and bustling as it was when I was a child...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|indent=true|Looking forward to it as well! Plus, never hurts to have a couple pairs of hands around here... who knows what a few new folks might bring to the table!}}
{{dialogue|Jane|indent=true|Fantastic. While you all handle that... I... am going to go order some new textbooks.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Sounds like a plan, everyone! Thank you, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=See, I've got this plate... and there's a lot on it...
|Ah, that's a shame. Well if anything changes, do let us know.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|See you later! Good luck with your... plate!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|I think three families are definitely on their way. Jane, were you in touch with them?}}
{{dialogue|Jane|Yeeess... I believe two of those familes have children, and each set of parents assured me that their children were all adorable as well as intelligent. That's, of course... what they all say. But this time, I have a feeling it's true!}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|They're very excited to move in here. Really the only thing they're waiting on is having the right home!}}
