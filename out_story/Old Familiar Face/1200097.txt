{{dialogue|Owen|''Player''! Ah-hah! What a coincidence! Hey, ''Player'', this is Butch, an old traveling buddy of mine. I've been tryin' to get him to come to Sandrock, but he was scared off by those rumors I told you about!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|Yes, yes, ''Player''! You are a kind soul indeed!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|Back to the matter at hand! Owen, my good man, those photos were enough to set my plans in motion, but now that I'm here, I expect the finest in hospitality!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|Otherwise I might be forced to spill a few details about our sordid past affairs in front of your friend here...}}

*{{flirt}}''Sordid past affairs, eh?''
*''What photos?''
*''I'll leave you two to it.''

{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=Sordid past affairs, eh?
|Oh, c'mon man, don't say it like that! I don't even know what you're on about; and ''Player'', hey! Quit stirrin' the pot!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|Oh, you know exactly what I'm "on about!" ''Player'', this bohemian retiree you see before you is a different man than the one I knew in our traveling days! Yes, we were young and carefree, never knowing where we'd lay our heads next...}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|And of course, wherever we found ourselves, there were always women chasing him. Say, Owen, remember that lady who tried to kiss you right when you walked into that bar in Lucien? Does she still send you love letters?}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Man, can you cut it out? You're really embarrassing me! But. if you must know... No, she does not.}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|Hahah! Alright, I had my fun. But you know, Owen, there's one thing we're all still trying to understand: why take up your Pa's old post? Why Sandrock? You could've landed anywhere with your talent and looks.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Eh, well. My roots are here. I've been all over the Free Cities, and there's nowhere like here. There's the scenery to speak of, plus I found some people that I feel at home with, and that's enough for me, I reckon.}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|Fair, I suppose! I must admit that my horizons have been broadened simply by way of stumbling here; I'll have to keep looking around! Perhaps I'll see whatever it is you're seeing.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Hey, ''Player'', thanks for helpin' my friend out here; you should take a little something for your trouble. You deserve it for puttin' up with this guy!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|answer=What photos?
|Yes, the ones posted in the Atara Times! I never would've come here if not for those photos, and I can hardly be blamed!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|Those rumors are rather macabre; they say you fight over water and drink Yakmel blood when there's not enough to go around! I'd be a fool not to at least take the rumors into consideration...}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Yo, Butch, here's the big twist: you know who took those photos?}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|What? ''Player''?! I'd thanked you for aiding me on the last leg of my journey, but in fact it was you who brought me every step of the way!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|I must say, I was moved by your photography; I apologize, I thought you just to be a kind-hearted traveler!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Nah, ''Player'' does it all! Photography, farmin', sword-swingin', gun-slingin'... but they're mainly known in Sandrock for being a Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|My stars! They keep churning out these young folk more and more talented, I swear! Well, I really must thank you, ''Player''. I wouldn't be here if not for your photographs.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|Thanks a lot, ''Player''! Hey, let me get this rabid fan outta your hair, him and I got some serious catching up to do! Let's hang out soon!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|So long, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Owen|indent=true|answer=I'll leave you two to it.
|Sure thing, and thanks again, ''Player''! If not for you, I'll bet this guy would still be out wanderin' in the desert; and what a tragedy that would be!}}
{{dialogue|Lost Tourist|indent=true|I believe you're right! I was very fortunate to run into you, ''Player''. Hope to see you around!}}
