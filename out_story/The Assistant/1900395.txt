*''No questions.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=No questions.
|Very well. We begin again tomorrow.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I have not had time to read your reports, but although you are lacking the desired experience, I was impressed with your dedication. You have lasted longer any other assistant. Well done.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Thank you for your feedback.
|You are welcome.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=So, you like spending time with me?
|Perhaps. I did enjoy researching with my friend when I was younger. But I have mostly sought solitude for my work ever since a certain cretin took credit for my effort back during my university days...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Working with you today have given me second thoughts on going at everything alone.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Regardless, I've certainly appreciated having you as an assistant.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|You may leave now. I've got more work to do. Goodbye.}}
