|Boredom: A treatise on the human condition. What is boredom? If we conceptualize boredom as simply an absence of entertainment, then how do we understand a concept by absence? For millenia, it is presumed that man has struggled with entertainment. By the end of the Old World, it seems that humankind had invented such a plethora of entertainment services, that "option paralysis" occured, the provision of so many options that choosing alone is frightening, and people thus return to our old nemesis; boredom. Counteracting boredom in face of a diminishing need for work became human kind's priority. Once labor was outsourced to machines, humankind no longer had to focus on creation, and instead turned to consumption. Perhaps, we can hypothesize, this was the beginning of the end for the peoples of the Old World. We may never know. All we may do is realize that boredom is humankind's oldest and most persistent nemesis.}}
