(cId 0) A conversation 44_0 starts:
{{dialogue|Cooper|Hey there Builder! Let me bend yer ear for a minute! I'd like to talk something about "friendship" with you.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Now y'see a friend in need is a friend indeed, however, if all yer friends jumped off a bridge, would you do it too? The answer here is clearly, "no."}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|That is unless the bridge were not particularly high off the ground, and additionally, above water, in which case, it would be not only safe but in fact quite pleasurable to jump off said bridge.}}

*''Keep listening''
*''You said 'a minute.'''

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=Keep listening
|Ergo, following yer friends in this instance is not a demonstration of the woes of peer pressure, but in fact an example as to how community betterment can occur through a mutual choosing of actions.}}

:*''Keep listening''
:*''Cooper, what do you need?!''

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=double|answer=Keep listening
|However, if you're lookin' at the question in this manner, yer perhaps disingenuously missin' the philosophical motive of the question and its rhetorical intention.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=double|And that is the examination of whether or not it is just and good to, as a general rule, take the road more travelled, to do what has been done before, and follow in the footsteps of traditionalism.}}

::*''Keep listening''
::*''Cooper, what do you really need?!''

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=3|answer=Keep listening
|By using the metaphor of bridge jumpin', rhetorically we imply that this is not the case. But where does this leave us, as Sandrockers, in a society founded on tradition?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=3|Are we obligated to lie about, aghast with our tongues tied, and then dragged helplessly off our metaphorical bridge, of inestablished height may I remind ya, as our ancestors were?}}

:::*''Keep listening''
:::*''Cooper, you... what... need ... you?''

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=4|answer=Keep listening
|Or rather, is it correct to scrutinize the bridge metaphor as being something of a straw man's argument? How can we claim that bridge jumping is an inherently foolish act when we, again, know nothing of the bridge itself?}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=4|These and many other issues perplex me, young'n. They keep me up at night. You like buildin' bridges don't ya, Builder?}}

::::*''Keep listening''
::::*''Cogper, need whaei fjkla oja.''

{{dialogue|Cooper|Heh, well, looks like I've done and got a little off topic again. The point I was tryin' to make is... uh... hm... Oh yeah!}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|I need you to make me a {{textcolor|green|fake yakmel}}. Y'see, yakmels are herd animals. Way I figure, if the yakmels think they might be leavin' one of their brethren behind, well, shoot, they might think twice about breakin' out of the ranch again.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|Whaddya say, pardner? Can I count on ya?}}

*''You can count on me, Cooper.''
*''Maybe later.'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Cooper|indent=true|answer=You can count on me, Cooper.
|Just what I like to hear! {{textcolor|green|Qi}} can probably design you a diagram. After you're done, you can {{textcolor|green|place them in my ranch}}. Hot dog! Maybe I can get Mabel to cook something up for ya when you finish!}}
