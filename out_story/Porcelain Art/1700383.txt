{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|answer=What's going on?
|Darling, you're here. This is Li-jun, Walnut Groove's Mayor, you must've met her at the summit before. We were discussing an upcoming ceramics exhibition. This is ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|Ah! Sandrock's famous ''Player'' and Amirah, you two are truly a match made in heaven. Let me clear things up a bit.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|answer=She's not single.
|What? Oh, I understand! I'm sorry, it appears I was mistaken!}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|Sandrock's famous ''Player'' and Amirah, you two are truly a match made in heaven. I actually wanted Amirah to contribute some works for an exhibition.}}

{{dialogue|Li-Jun|Walnut Groove is hosting a ceramics exhibition, to the theme of love. Amirah's ceramics have made quite a name for themselves, so I was inviting her to contribute some creations since I was in the neighborhood.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|She said she would like to think about it some more.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''That sounds great!''
*''You don't want to join in?''

{{dialogue|Amirah|I know that it's a really good opportunity, and it's honestly not that I'm not interested. But it's as Mayor and Li-jun says, in an exhibition about love, I wanted to make something with you.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|Isn't that just inspiring? So I guess I need to be asking her wonderful co-creator...}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|What do you think, dear?}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''If you want to, then I'll do it with you.''
*''I'm kind of busy lately...''

{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|answer=If you want to, then I'll do it with you.
|Brilliant! Seeing you two together... it's inspiring! I'll be waiting for your submission!}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|Come on, I have an idea.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|answer=I'm kind of busy lately...
|I understand, busy people. Well, the exhibition is a season from now, so you have time, be sure to join in. Any later and you'll miss it, I'm afraid. But I would just love to see your work there.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|Thank you, if we finish a piece, we shall send it to Walnut Groove.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|Good! Then I shall eagerly await your work.}}
