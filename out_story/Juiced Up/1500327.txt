{{dialogue|Nia|Hiya ''Player''! I have good news and great news! Which one do you want first?}}

*''Good news.''
*''Great news!''

{{dialogue|Nia|Uh... now that I think about, I have to tell it in chronological order or it doesn't make sense... Sorry.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Anyway, over the last few days, we did several soil experiments with the new algae species. And whadaya know, we found a type of chlorophyta algae that's not only resistant to saline but also has decent water retention!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|It means we'll be able to make a biocrust that works in Outback! The only drawback is the top soil out there lacks a lot of the nutrients needed for sustainable plant growth, so we'll have to apply fertilizer once in a while.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|...Considering the density of the Yakmel droppings around here, I'd say we have an acceptable situation.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Right! Now the better news is that Mayor Trudy has already seen the results and decided to fast track the planting of the first plot of the forest! ...And that's why we're here, we need your help for the preparation work.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Why don't you take over this part, Director Qi?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Sure thing, Assistant Nia. ''Player'', the old Hydroponic Incubator that you built for the Little Woods doesn't work well at producing the new algae type because it doesn't have fluid circulation, so I've been assigned to design a new one.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|After tearing apart the relics you brought back, which was fascinating, I was able to come up with the Hydroponic Cultivator. It has a continuous circulation system to allow for fluid flow and easier chemical adjustments. Here's the diagram.}}

*''It really worked?''
*''How did you get the Director to come here?''
*''I'll get right on it!''

{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=It really worked?
|Yeah! I think the scientists of the Old World were studying the algae for use in space, where they needed to continuously replenish the biocrusts to grow food. So we lucked out in that Sandrock's right on top of an Old World space launch city.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|answer=How did you get the Director to come here?
|Uh... oh, you know, Director Qi is... uh, very excited about our progress on this endeavor... and-}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|She bribed me with herbal tea from Highwind. She said you must be tired from your adventure in the lab ruins so she wanted me to walk all the way here instead. I acquiescented, because tea was delicious.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Ahhhhh!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|And I am excited about the progress!}}
{{dialogue|Nia|indent=true|Sigh...}}
{{dialogue|Nia|When you're done, please install it in the Moisture Farm. We set aside space for three Hydroponic Cultivators, which should be enough to churn out all the algae we need. Mi-an and the Commissioner will make the other two.}}
{{dialogue|Nia|Thanks ''Player''! You're the best!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh, by the way, the Mayor also asked me to make an upgrade for the Mobile Suit so that it's capable of helping with the planting of the forest. I'm currently coming up with some exciting ideas, of which I hope you'll help me implement at a later date.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|From one Mobile Suit lover to another, I thought you'd want to know.}}
