{{dialogue|Justice|Yo! Grace! Are you pokin' around The Breach again?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Just going for a walk. Don't tell me that's against the law, now?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|No, uh, only walkin' that's against the law is jaywalking, but er- Hey! Point is, don't even think about goin' in there. We can't let civs through without the proper training. I hate to be dramatic, but: what's worth more to you: your papers or your life?}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I know that's meant to be rhetorical, but probably my dissertation... When is the Breach going to be re-opened to the public? I would like to look for more relics at some point.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|It'll open when it's open! Which is to say, when it's been re-classified as an Abandoned Ruins. And don't even think about tryin' to sneak in there. I wouldn't want to, but I do have the right to detain you if you're provin' to be a danger to yourself...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|What's the basis for all these wild accusations? I walk down this way all the time. This imagined notion of me even thinking of "sneaking in" to The Breach is just that, something you've just made up in your head.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I also have to notice that The Breach has been this way for quite some time... normally, I would've expected you Corps type to have this handled already. Sir, if I may ask, is the stress getting to you?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Hey, c'mon! Give us a break! We've been up to our eyeballs in Geeglers, plus there's Logan... Ugh, yeah, it is gettin' to be a little rough out here, as a matter of fact. Glad somebody noticed!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Aw. Poor Justice. Why don't you just take a day off? What you need is some rest. Then you'll have your edge back. I mean, at the very least, surely you don't need to literally stand here in front of The Breach; we all know not to go in...}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Yeah... maybe I could just head back to the office, pour a big ol' glass of Yakmel Milk, kick up my heels and... Hey, wait a sec! Dang, how come every time I talk to you I end up with a headache?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|Look, Grace. I'm not kiddin' around. I take the safety of everybody in this town seriously. If somethin' happened to you down there, I'd never forgive myself. Talk to me again when your fightin' chops are up to snuff, like, say, ''Player'''s here.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|''Player''? Hm, right, right... How about this, then: if I were to commission ''Player'' to enter the ruins on my behalf, you'd have no objections to that, would you, Sheriff?}}

*''All I do is dive!''
*''(Say nothing.)''

{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=All I do is dive!
|Oh, uh. Well, no. I guess that'd all be pretty by the book in my book. I reckon it's on the two of you to work somethin' out.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|answer=(Say nothing.)
|Eh? Well, I suppose if ''Player'' agrees to it, sure, why not? All depends on a little thing called "consent."}}
{{dialogue|Justice|indent=true|Well, the two of you figure something out. Just don't go into The Breach by yourself, alright?}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I gotta keep patrolin', but I'm gonna have my eye on you. Maybe just... adjust your stroll path to be a little less hair-raisin', alright? Y'all're gonna be the death of me...}}
