{{dialogue|Grace|Ah hah! What's all this then...? Hm, slight damage around the edges, bit of fading, but you can make out the font pretty clearly. "Admiral Salt something something," "No Thanks, Computer..."}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Probably from around 250 Before Peach if I had to guess. Would probably score a preservation rating of at least a B back with the professors. Nice find, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Grace|...And good timing, too. My latest essay topic was just approved: "Old World Utilization Theory: A Case Study on Sandrock's 'The Breach.'" Mouthful that it is, my essay titles are actually more concise than most.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Anyway, this helps me build my case around my "hooky hypothesis," so thanks again ''Player''.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Wasn't too much trouble I hope? Dangerous? You appear to be in once piece, at least.}}

*''It was dangerous, but I handled it.''
*''Eh, not so bad. Next time, you go.''

{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=It was dangerous, but I handled it.
|Oh yeah? Make sure you train if you're going to keep diving like this though. "Follow through with your strikes, use all your weight to attack, don't forget to exercise your core." Just some tips I saw in Ruin Divers Seasonly.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|indent=true|answer=Eh, not so bad. Next time, you go.
|Eh? You think I look tough enough to go in there? Well, unfortunately, our good friend Sheriff Justice wouldn't agree with you...}}
{{dialogue|Grace|Well, in any case, you've been a lot of help. If, hypothetically, I'd gone into The Breach myself, I wouldn't have had all this time to get a jump start on my essay. Oh, speaking of which, I'll let you know how that goes. Thanks again!}}
