{{dialogue|Andy|What's so good about Sunday school? I heard it was a rotten time where you just sit listening to boring church stories! And worse, the even boring-er kid versions where there's no blood or guts!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Hm. Yeah. It is kinda like that. But you can just think of other stuff while they're talking. The church people are funny!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Burgess is cute. He's afraid of everything! Last week the cat knocked over a bottle, and we spent the whole day checking the church for ghosts.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Heh...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Pen thinks he's the prettiest man in the world. We can just take him to a room with a mirror. He'll stay there all day, then we can go play!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Heh heh... cool...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Hey, so... um... you're always gonna be at Sunday school...?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Yep!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Well. Um. Maybe I can stick around this town for a while...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|Hey! ''Player''! Tell Andy how fun Sunday school is gonna be!}}

*''It's super boring...''
*''You're going to have fun.''
*''Behave yourself. Otherwise, you're dealing with me.''

{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|answer=It's super boring...
|Aw, what do you know about fun, anyway? Chasin' down and capturin' good honest bandits just tryin' to have a good time? You're a buzzkill, Builder.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|I thought you were cool, ''Player''! Andy fooled everyone but you!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|Yeah. Well. I mean. Grumble mumble grumble...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|You're gonna like it here, Andy. I promise!}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|answer=You're going to have fun.
|Yeah! See? You're gonna like everything about Sandrock better than being a bandit!}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|Erm. Well, I dunno about that. How am I supposed to live my life without doing crimes?}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|I think you'll find it surprisingly easy...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|answer=Behave yourself. Otherwise, you're dealing with me.
|Ooh, big bad Builder, what with your ace detective skills, and yer indomitable determination, and yer combat expertise, and yer... yer...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|Eh...}}
{{dialogue|Andy|indent=true|I-I'll be good...}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|indent=true|Yay!}}
