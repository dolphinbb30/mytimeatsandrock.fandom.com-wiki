{{dialogue|Burgess|Hi there, friend! I couldn't help but notice you're doing something illegal! We are {{textcolor|red|not allowed to cut down trees}} near the town.}}

*''I'm sorry, I didn't know.''
*''I do what I like.''

{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=I'm sorry, I didn't know.
|Oh! Cutting down trees around town can have some seriously negative effects on our environment!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|indent=true|answer=I do what I like.
|Not funny! What you're doing right now can have some serious consequences for our environment!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Seeing as this is your first offence, I'll let it slide... But if I catch you out here chopping down public trees again, well... I'll have no choice but to fine you to the full extent Sandrock nuisancery law allows for!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Worse than that, though: why... if I saw you chopping down trees, I- I {{textcolor|green|don't know if I would want to be your friend anymore}}! I'm sure a lot of people around town would feel the same way...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|But don't you worry: you can find {{textcolor|green|wood scrap}} out in the desert, {{textcolor|green|buy imported wood from me}}, even {{textcolor|green|plant your own trees}} on your own property! See? Plenty of ways! So you really have no need to chop these trees down!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|That's all, Builder! Conserve water! And don't chop down these trees!}}
