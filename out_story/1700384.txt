{{dialogue|Amirah|I... I need to think about it.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|It's a celebration of love! It would be wonderful to have a strong, single woman who is as dedicated to her career to join.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''What are you talking about?''
*''Yeah, Amirah's the best!''

{{dialogue|Amirah|indent=true|answer=What are you talking about?
|Hello, ''Player''. This is Li-jun, the Mayor of Walnut Groove. We're discussing an upcoming exhibition.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|Ah, ''Player''! We've met before, you've got quite the reputation! Please, help me convince Amirah to lend her expertise to our exhibition!}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|indent=true|answer=Yeah, Amirah's the best!
|I told her that already! There's an upcoming exhibition in Walnut Groove, and we just can't go without her entry!}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|Walnut Groove is hosting a ceramics exhibition, to the theme of love. Amirah's ceramics have made quite a name for themselves, so I was inviting her to contribute some creations since I was in the neighborhood.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|She said she would like to think about it some more.}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I say?)}}

*''That sounds great!'' (No unique dialogue)
*''You don't want to join in?'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Amirah|I don't know... I've never done anything like this before. I'm not particularly competitive... And it's such a short time, I don't want to sacrifice my other orders.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|I understand, busy people. Well, the exhibition is a season from now, so you have time, be sure to join in. Any later and you'll miss it, I'm afraid. But I would just love to see your work there.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|I understand that art takes time, but I know you can do this. You have something special, Amirah. Help me show the world.}}
{{dialogue|Amirah|Thank you for your faith in me... I will try. If I manage to finish within the deadline I will send it over.}}
{{dialogue|Li-Jun|Good! Then I shall eagerly await your work.}}
