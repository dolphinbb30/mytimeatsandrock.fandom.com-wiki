If the player successfully completes the mission, some of the townsfolk will comment on it:

{{dialogue|Amirah|It's really heartbreaking to see something Trudy was so confident about run into such misfortune. I pray that this be only a stumble, and we'll soon be back on the path towards success.}}
{{dialogue|Andy|Why's everyone so mad? Can't ya jus' plant another? Doin' the same thing over and over, expecting a different result... that's the definition of... hard work and stick-to-it-iveness!}}
{{dialogue|Arvio|What? The forest failed? How could that be? Has anyone contacted Musa? Can we just throw more money at the problem?}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Heyyy, ''Player''... how are things going with the forest? Haha, you know, it's the weirdest thing, nobody seems to want to talk to me about it. You don't think... tch... Nah! You don't think people would be afraid to give me bad news because they think I'd fly into a panic? Because I totally would!}}
{{dialogue|Catori|Forest isn't growing? Well... like I always say, "Never get your hopes up." Ah, don't worry. It's not over til it's over. We have time to sort things out.}}
{{dialogue|Cooper|I remember when I laughed at Trudy for failin' out in the desert long ago. Well, who's laughin' now? Not me. As you can clearly see. This is... well, ''Player'', this is an absolute travesty. I wish 'em the best, hope it gets figured out.}}
{{dialogue|Dan-bi|Gah! It's so frustrating to be a footsoldier in the war against the desert when nobody has any orders! Have you heard anything from Zeke yet? Still nothing? Grr...}}
{{dialogue|Elsie|What the heck's wrong with them trees out there? They only got one job, and that's to grow! It's for their own self-interests! We'll figure this out. Anything anybody needs of me, you come runnin', y'hear?}}
{{dialogue|Ernest|The planting failed? Well, maybe this is just the low point in a rise to success type story! We kinda had that already, though, didn't we...?}}
{{dialogue|Fang|The forests... You mustn't give up. You are capable. All of you. Persevere.}}
{{dialogue|Grace|I wish I could help with the greenification efforts, but I really only have the most fundamental understanding of biology, let alone the incredibly specific field of knowledge that Zeke is essentially pioneering. Good luck, Zeke. Good luck, Trudy...}}
{{dialogue|Heidi|Don't worry, ''Player''. This is just a minor hiccup. We're going to figure out what's gone wrong with our forest, and one day, this'll just be a footnote in the history books.}}
{{dialogue|Hugo|I hate to see Trudy look so defeated. Nothing can keep her down for long, though. I bet she's gonna bounce back with more determination than ever.}}
{{dialogue|Jasmine|What happened...? Why didn't the trees grow? I thought... I thought we did everything right?}}
{{dialogue|Jensen|Anything the train station can do to help the forest situation? I'm saying this as a last resort, but if you need one of our passenger cars converted into something to transport fertilizer. Well. I'll do it.}}
{{dialogue|Justice|I guess my whole take on the tree thing is... Nothin' wrong with gettin' somethin' wrong. But when you don't know why you failed... that's when folk start getting nervous. Hope we figure this out, and quick.}}
{{dialogue|Krystal|I hope everyone's handling this forest setback well enough. Yeah, we'd kind of found our stride before but... with all that's happened in the past, I could see how some folk would take this pretty hard...}}
{{dialogue|Larry|If you wish to defeat the desert, you must strike fear into the hearts of your enemies! For you, strong human, I will go and yawp my most bloodcurdling of battlecries at these sands until they submit to your will!}}
{{dialogue|Logan|Don't get shook. Yeah, we don't know what's wrong with the forest. But panic'll get us nowhere. Everybody, keep your head on straight, we'll figure this out.}}
{{dialogue|Mabel|Ah... I felt like for a moment there, we had so much confidence. For the first time in forever, I thought it was going to be smooth sailin' from here on out but... the trees aren't growin'? After all this?}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|You know, after helping Zeke with his work, I feel like farming is so much harder than building. When we're building things, we are in complete control. With growing plants, more than half of it is up to mother nature...}}
{{dialogue|Mi-an|Don't worry, ''Player''. I'm confident that whatever the problem is we can figure it out. We always do! Plus, we're getting in touch with Dr. Luo, that expert from your hometown... Have you two ever met...?}}
{{dialogue|Miguel|Hm. Well. As you surely know by now, men make plans. Nature laughs.}}
{{dialogue|Mort|Progress is never easy. But we started by simply sticking straw in the sand to slow the storms. We wouldn't have come this far if we let any of those old failures stop us.}}
{{dialogue|Owen|Man, even with the Portian water, we still can't keep the forest going? That's not good. Not good at all...}}
{{dialogue|Pablo|I wish those trees would stop being little drama queens and just grow already!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|That is the one frustrating thing about science. Sometimes you're quite sure you've accounted for every conceivable detail... and yet your experiment fails. And you have no idea why. The good news, is that there is always an answer out there...}}
{{dialogue|Rian|For the tree thing, don't think of it as failure. Think of it as... finding new ways that don't work.}}
{{dialogue|Rocky|Ah, shucks, I heard about the trees. I'm sure you wanna get out there and hit back. But listen, ain't you, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep gettin' back up.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|We're so close, ''Player''! I think we just need another set of eyes to help out Zeke. The progress we've made has already captured the Alliance's attention, I'm sure others will be willing to help us out.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|It's okay, everything will be fine. It'll just take time.}}
{{dialogue|Unsuur|Hey, heard the planting is going great. Maybe we should henceforth refer to today as "Tree Day." It's not? Oh. It's going horribly? Wow... worst Tree Day ever.}}
{{dialogue|Venti|Hum? You tried hard... but didn't succeed? I'm sorry, that doesn't really compute in my worldview. Just try harder!}}
{{dialogue|Vivi|So I've heard the planting isn't going as well as anticipated. That's alright, dear. We've been through worse. You just sleep on it and we'll know what to do soon, I promise.}}
{{dialogue|Wei|Come now, where's that Sandrockor spirit I've heard so much about? I'm sure whatever it is giving you all trouble with that forest will be sorted in a jiff!}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|I'm used to failure. It's usually the first ten or so stops on the way to success. I'm just worried this one's come at a bad time...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Ah... it just wasn't enough...}}
