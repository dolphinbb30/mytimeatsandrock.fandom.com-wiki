{{dialogue|Trudy|Ah, ''Player'', you're here too. This sandstorm... it hit us hard. We're kind of at our wits' end here. Luckily Irrigation Tower is still intact, but everything else...}}
{{dialogue|Zeke|Trudy... Uhm, I think we're at the limit of what we can do alone. I heard that there is uh, agricultural expert in Highwind, Professor Luo. Maybe we can ask him to come to Sandrock and work with us?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Good idea. We can't just give up... I'll send a telegram to Highwind.}}

*''Professor Luo? I've heard that name before...''
*''So we're short on water again?''

{{dialogue|Zeke|indent=true|answer=Professor Luo? I've heard that name before...
|He's pretty famous around Highwind, I hear. I wouldn't be surprised if you've heard of him.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Hey, I hear ''Player'''s quite the celebrity in Highwind these days! Maybe a name drop in the invitation will up our chances of getting him to come?}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|answer=So we're short on water again?
|If we want to have this forest... then yes.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Even if we somehow lower our consumption, I just don't see how we can balance the forest's requirements with our residents' needs. We... might need to put the forest on hold.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|indent=true|Sigh. Let's reassess the situation. We'll need to come up with a new plan.}}
{{dialogue|Trudy|Well, I think there's nothing more we can do today. Let's clean up and head back. ''Player'', thanks for coming, I'll let you know if anything new comes up.}}
