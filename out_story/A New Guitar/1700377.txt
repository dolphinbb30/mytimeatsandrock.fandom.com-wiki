{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|answer=No problem, leave it to me.

{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|But I don't want to abandon the aesthetic and feel. ''Player'', can you help me make an acoustic guitar with some sand and wind resistance, without changing the sound?}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|You need a recipe design, right? That's how you Builders do things? Maybe it'd be good to ask a local carpenter, see if they have any ideas.}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|Thank you so much, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|answer=Sorry, I've got a lot on my plate.
|No problem, just let me know if you have some time.}}
