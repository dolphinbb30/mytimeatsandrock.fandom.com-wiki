{{dialogue|Penny|Is it true? You're a Builder, ''Player''? Can you help me with the guitar?}}

*''No problem, leave it to me.''
*''Sorry, I've got a lot on my plate.''

{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|answer=No problem, leave it to me.
|I think Cooper and Hugo were right. I probably need a sturdier guitar if I'm looking to make a career out of it.}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|Sandrock's really dry, so it'll easily warp and crack the wood of a normal wooden guitar...}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|But I don't want to abandon the aesthetic and feel. ''Player'', can you help me make an acoustic guitar with some sand and wind resistance, without changing the sound?}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|You need a recipe design, right? That's how you Builders do things? Maybe it'd be good to ask a local carpenter, see if they have any ideas.}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|Thank you so much, ''Player''!}}
{{dialogue|Penny|indent=true|answer=Sorry, I've got a lot on my plate.
|No problem, just let me know if you have some time.}}
