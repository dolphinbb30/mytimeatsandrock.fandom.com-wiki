{{dialogue|Qi|We've only just begun. In fact, we've finished our warm-up exercises and are about ready to dive into the actual material.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|''Pet Name'', which material would you like to be responsible for tutoring? I'd imagined you might take charge of the language assignments and I the math.}}

*''Sure, I'll take language.''
*''You might need to take the lead on both...''
*''I'm speaking a language right now!''

{{dialogue|Child|indent=true|answer=Sure, I'll take language.
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=1}}|reward={{NPC2|Child|rp=1}}|Alright! We're ready!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=You might need to take the lead on both...
|Ahem... ''Pet Name''... I'm afraid that my knowledge of the liberal arts extends to the lengths of an adjunct professor at best...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Furthermore, for the sake of appearances, I suggest we both take on a role of authority here. If need be, I'll assist you to the best of my ability in a way that does not undermine your integrity as an educator.}}
{{dialogue|Child|indent=true|Let's go already!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I'm speaking a language right now!
|Indeed you are. Bravo.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Let's see what we've been given here...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|"A summit meeting involving the Mayors of Atara, Tallsky, Portia, as well as the Chief Builder from Highwind is occurring. If all of them shake hands with each other when they meet, how many total handshakes will occur at that time?"}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Permutations? Sure, why not? When did we learn that, ''Pet Name''? Kindergarten?}}
{{dialogue|Child|Everybody shakes hands with everybody? That's gross...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Yes, I had issues with that at your age as well. Not to worry, we can always wash our hands with soap after touching something "gross."}}
{{dialogue|Child|Where's the Mayor of Highwind?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|There is not enough information provided to know what has happened to the mayor; perhaps he is ill. Perhaps he doesn't like summits anymore.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Perhaps he is there in disguise, plotting revenge against the other attendees. The possibilities are endless. Since we can't know, better to just work with what we've been given.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Let's begin solving the problem by answering this: how many people are there... with plans to shake hands?}}
{{dialogue|Child|Five.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Hm... Mayor of Atara, Mayor of Tallsky, Mayor of Portia, Builder of Highwind: I count four. Care to explain your reasoning?}}
{{dialogue|Child|Trudy would be there.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Likely, yes.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|However, the text here says clearly that she is not.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Why?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|The writers of the textbook likely thought four was enough.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Why?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Four is a complicated enough number to demonstrate that you understand the mathematical concept; adding another name would be a waste of ink.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Why?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|There is no inherent difference in difficulty calculating something by four or five.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Why?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|This is simply how the human mind works.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Why?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|A massive, randomly generated series of events unfolded across eternity and the cosmos to arrive at this particular iteration of consciousness and all the quirks that come with it.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Why?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Because...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Your parents love you very much.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Hmmmmm... Okay!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Sweetie: we need to use our imagination, alright? Let's imagine that only four people are at this summit, alright?}}

*''C'mon kiddo, focus!''
*''You two are too cute together.''
*''Remind you of anyone...?''

{{dialogue|Child|indent=true|answer=C'mon kiddo, focus!
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=1}}|You're right, ''Parent Name''! I can do this!}}
{{dialogue|Child|indent=true|answer=You two are too cute together.
|reward={{NPC2|Child|rp=1}}|Hahaha!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Your amiable commentary is duly noted, but we can't encourage this kind of behavior...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Remind you of anyone...?
|Some of this behavior matches descriptions given by my parents and grandfather of my own, but surely their accounts were embellished for the sake of narrative; by my own recollection, I was an extraordinarily well-behaved little boy.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Let's return our focus to the problem, shall we? The next question we need to ask: how many times will the first person shake hands?}}
{{dialogue|Child|I got the answer already! It's six. The first mayor shakes with the other three people, take her out. Then the next mayor shakes hands twice, take him out. Then the Builder only has one more person left to shake hands with. Six handshakes.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I see. So you've known the answer this entire time.}}
{{dialogue|Child|That's why I said it was gross...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|"Make your own comparison. Example: Your voice is like music, it sounds good to me."}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Seems simple enough. X is like Y, where Z is a defining characteristic that binds them. Another example might be... eh... Quantum mechanics is like a box of chocolates- hm, that's no good... often you do and don't know what you're going to get at the same time...}}

{{dialogue|Child|indent=true|Hahaha! And you never remember anybody's name! "Who?" "Whooooo!?"}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I'm afraid this comparison fails: I don't bother to ask "who," I just call them by their profession or choose a new designation based on their appearance.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Our house is like a castle, safe and roomy.
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=1}}|reward={{NPC2|Child|rp=1}}|Yes, that is a rather apt comparison. Although, castles have more defensive measures built in than our home. That can be fixed, however. In due time.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Researchers are like liquid nitrogen: cooler than ice.
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=3}}|reward={{NPC2|Child|rp=3}}|H... huh!?}}
{{dialogue|Child|indent=true|Yeah, Pa! You're so cool! Like liquid... nibrogym...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Oh. I thought you meant temperature-wise and that my life was in danger. Thank you. Very... "cool." Both of you.}}
{{dialogue|Child|Okay, okay, I got one!}}
{{dialogue|Child|Learning is like the desert. It goes on forever and ever and it's easy to get lost, but... sometimes it can be really beautiful!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Oh. Why... yes. I think that's very true. Did you think of that yourself?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|''Pet Name'', it's exceptionally rare for a child to show such talent in so many different areas. It's almost as if... as if... our child is...}}

*''A genius!''
*''As smart as you!''
*''As smart as me!''
*''The best of both of us.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=A genius!
|Precisely.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=As smart as you!
|My talents at this age were not so eclectic.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=As smart as me!
|Can you also claim to have these kinds of math skills at such a young age? I think our child will surpass both of us one day...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=The best of both of us.
|Perhaps so.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|With proper planning, we should be able to get you through university by ten or eleven...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Little one, isn't that splendid news? You'll be able to accomplish all of the goals I never could as a child! Which I can then, of course, live through you vicariously. You might be a researcher by the ripe young age of eighteen!}}
{{dialogue|Child|Huh? I don't wanna be a researcher. I just wanna play and have fun.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|What the- ...Fun!? Oh... darling... where did it all go wrong...?}}

*''You don't have to figure this out yet, honey...'' (No unique dialogue)
*''And you know what's really fun? Being a Builder!'' (No unique dialogue)
*''Research is cool, though!'' (No unique dialogue)

{{dialogue|Child|I'm gonna be a poet!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|A poet? Who has put such preposterous ideas into your head?}}
{{dialogue|Child|Grandma Vivi! I made a rhyme on accident. She said I'm a poet and I didn't know it! But now I do...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I see. There is no denying that also rhymes. However, I do warn you that poets are not known for having comfortable lives. Don't listen to the writer boy who locks himself in his room; his parents have bought him his entire career.}}
{{dialogue|Child|I don't care about that...}}
{{dialogue|Child|"Time goes fast and time goes slow..."}}
{{dialogue|Child|"Fast when I play, slow when I work at home!"}}
{{dialogue|Child|That's my poem! I'm gonna go play now! Bye bye!}}

|Some of this behavior matches descriptions given by my parents and grandfather of my own, but surely their accounts were embellished for the sake of narrative; by my own recollection, I was an extraordinarily well-behaved little boy.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Let's return our focus to the problem, shall we? The next question we need to ask: how many times will the first person shake hands?}}
{{dialogue|Child|I got the answer already! It's six. The first mayor shakes with the other three people, take her out. Then the next mayor shakes hands twice, take him out. Then the Builder only has one more person left to shake hands with. Six handshakes.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|I see. So you've known the answer this entire time.}}
{{dialogue|Child|That's why I said it was gross...}}

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I'm afraid this comparison fails: I don't bother to ask "who," I just call them by their profession or choose a new designation based on their appearance.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Our house is like a castle, safe and roomy.
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=1}}|reward={{NPC2|Child|rp=1}}|Yes, that is a rather apt comparison. Although, castles have more defensive measures built in than our home. That can be fixed, however. In due time.}}

{{dialogue|Qi|Oh. Why... yes. I think that's very true. Did you think of that yourself?}}
{{dialogue|Qi|''Pet Name'', it's exceptionally rare for a child to show such talent in so many different areas. It's almost as if... as if... our child is...}}

*''A genius!''
*''As smart as you!''

{{dialogue|Qi|With proper planning, we should be able to get you through university by ten or eleven...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|Little one, isn't that splendid news? You'll be able to accomplish all of the goals I never could as a child! Which I can then, of course, live through you vicariously. You might be a researcher by the ripe young age of eighteen!}}

{{dialogue|Qi|I see. There is no denying that also rhymes. However, I do warn you that poets are not known for having comfortable lives. Don't listen to the writer boy who locks himself in his room; his parents have bought him his entire career.}}
