{{dialogue|Qi|It is a very big ruin, I'm only cataloging the most standout of technologies, I'll leave the rest to the other researchers and archaeologists... Even so, it'll take me a while. It is a very big ruin.}}

(cId 1) A conversation 3883_3_1 starts:
{{dialogue|Qi|I just got back from the Starship Ruins. It was filled with such fascinating relics and science... I couldn't sleep, I just kept on absorbing...}}
{{dialogue|Player|(What should I ask?)}}

*''You absolutely sure there's a reservoir up there?''
*''You sure the water will be safe?''
*''Did you find anything else interesting there?''
*''I didn't see any water on my way through the ruin...''
*''I don't have any more questions.''

{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=You absolutely sure there's a reservoir up there?
|It's a space facility, pretty much everything they need to send anything into space needs water at some point...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Think about it. For the starship, they need water to make hydrogen for the fusion reactor and oxygen for the crew. Then they also need water to make antihydrogen for the antimatter engine, which by the way is very superlative but I have no idea how it works.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|On top of that, they still need extra water for the crew, for cooling down the launch structure during lift off, and even for muffling the shockwaves from the thrusters!}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|Plus, I read it in a book.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=You sure the water will be safe?
|reward={{NPC2|Qi|rp=5}}|Could it be contaminated? Sure... but most likely it's fine...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I read before that the filter systems used in the Old World pretty much insured all water were clean to use. In fact, they even had procedures to reintroduce minerals back into the filtered water because it was so pure.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|As long as the filters are still working and the reservoir doesn't have any cracks... hmm, maybe I should go revisit my math...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=Did you find anything else interesting there?
|Yes.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I found a quantum communicator, but I don't know how to operate it. There's a user manual, but it doesn't even say how to turn it on! It's like whoever designed this wanted me to be confounded! Unlucky for them... I enjoy a good challenge.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I also tested a cryocell, but it wasn't working. Which was good for me, and in turn, Sandrock, in the end. Because I didn't really have a plan for if it did work...}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I didn't see any water on my way through the ruin...
|According to some of the base documents I found, there are several wings to this facility. You were in the starship launch section, there are others.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|I'd assume the reservior and the Atmospheric Water Generator would be somewhere close by.}}
{{dialogue|Qi|indent=true|answer=I don't have any more questions.
|Sure, I'll meet you there tomorrow.}}
