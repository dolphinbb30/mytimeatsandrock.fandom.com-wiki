{{dialogue|Burgess|Hello, new Builder! It is wonderful to have you here amongst our desert flock! I am Burgess, Chief Safety Inspector of the Sandrock chapter of the Church of the Light.}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I mostly patrol the oasis, and if that water level moves even a centimeter, boy, you'd better believe I'll let everyone and their mother know about it! Now, where was I...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Ah, yes! As per the Minister's instructions, I have come with a gift. {{textcolor|green|Water}}, to be more specific. The most precious gift of all!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|In Sandrock, Martle's Oasis is pretty much our only reliable source of natural water. We also get some water from the other city-states, but it's expensive, so we need to be really careful and smart about how we divvy it out...}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Might I bring your attention to the humble little fence propped up around the oasis... It's the town's friendly way of saying: 'don't take water out of the oasis all willy-nilly! ...Or cut down the trees, for that matter...'}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|If you're short on water in your workshop, might I recommend checking the plants around your workshop for fresh morning {{textcolor|green|dew}}... or just come on down to the {{textcolor|green|water tower}} overlooking the oasis!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|I'm pretty sure Builder machines {{textcolor|green|won't run without water in their Water Tank}}... So I guess that means we'll be seeing a lot of each other in the future!}}
{{dialogue|Burgess|Well, I won't take up any more of your time. See you at the water tower, new pal!}}
